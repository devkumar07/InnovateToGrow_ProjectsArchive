		"Project Title": "Walker Phase 2",
		"Background": "Many patients with neurologic problems such as stroke, neuropathy, spinal cord injury, etc. have trouble walking. One of the most common aids to walking is a walker. The walker generally prevents a patient from falling forward or to the side but not backward. Designing a walker that will not easily fall over would be very important to many patients. The client Mark Stecker is a neurologist who takes care of many patients with problems walking. A previous capstone group addressed this problem but the result was not entirely successful.",
		"Problem": "The problem is to build a walker that has additional stability to tipping over. Radically changing the design of the walker by making it larger or heavier will make it difficult for the patient to use and make them more prone to falls. An approach not considered by the last group is based on the fact that walkers are generally made from hollow aluminum tubing. This creates the possibility of replacing the standard feet that touch the ground with linear actuators that fit inside the existing tubing of a walker. The actuators could then be controlled by a small computer CPU such as arduino with inputs from pressure on all 4 feet and gyroscopic information about the orientation of the walker produce signals that will level the walker dynamically and prevent falls.",
		"Objectives": "Step 1-Take existing walker and see what types of linear actuator can be inserted reasonably and securely. Step 2-Create system to monitor pressure on legs of walker and orientation of walker. Step 3-Create control system that will level the walker when the system detects a potential fall in progress",

		"Background": "The UCSF Fresno Medical Education Program is a major clinical and educational branch of the University of California, San Francisco. For more than 40 years, in collaboration with several clinical and community partners, the program has offered medical education and training for residents, fellows and students as well as conducted research, provided continuing education opportunities and public service. UCSF Fresno is a nationally-recognized model for community and university partnership, which offers people in Californias San Joaquin Valley access to high-quality and culturally responsive health care while enabling physicians in training— working alongside the finest faculty—to experience the dynamic interplay of medical academicians, research and patient care.",
		"Problem": "Tests for TB or Valley Fever require placing a skin test and reading the results (as measured by induration) 48-72 hours later.  Reading the tests requires expertise (reaction size measured in millimeters) and two visits-one to place and one to read the test.  Both of these limit the utility of the testing.  Smart phone technology (camera, measurement tools, etc.) could do the accurate readings remotely and therefore avoid the second visit.",
		"Objectives": "Create a mobile app that takes a photo of the skin test area before the skin test takes place. It will remind the patient to take another photo of the same area within 48 – 72 hours. It then measures the size of the result of the skin test based on the two photos taken and reports the result in text format.",

		"Project Title": "Fish Strainer",
		"Background": "The Turlock Irrigation District (TID) was formed in 1887 and was the first publicly owned irrigation district in the state. Today, TID provides irrigation water to more than 5,800 growers in a 307 square-mile service area that incorporates 149,500 acres of irrigable Central Valley farmland. TID also provides electricity to houses, farmers, businesses, and industrial and municipal customers in a 662 square-mile service area that includes portions of Stanislaus, Merced, Tuolumne, and Mariposa counties. Included in TIDs infrastructure is a Water Treatment Plan located in La Grange, California. The Water Treatment Plant system is composed of a raw water pump station, water treatment processing facility, and finish water storage tanks. The system treats water and delivers it to the residents of La Grange for domestic and fire protection needs.",
		"Problem": "Drainage from TID’s irrigation operations flows to the San Joaquin River through facilities that are located in the vicinity of the River’s eastern bank. The drainage facilities typically consist of earthen canals and metal culverts that convey the drainage through the flood protection levees and into the River. Migrating adult salmon and other fish species in the River occasionally mistake these drainage flows as natural streams, swim into the drainage facilities and become stranded. When this occurs, attempts are made to rescue the fish before they expire.",
		"Objectives": "The team will be required to develop a viable solution to prevent fish from entering two of TID’s drainage facilities, known as the Harding Drain and the Nielsen Drain. A challenging factor associated with this issue is that the Harding Drain and Nielsen Drain also convey a significant amount of aquatic weeds to the River. Aquatic weeds are undesirable plants that grow and reproduce in irrigation and drainage systems that, among other things, impede flow capacity. TID’s aquatic weed abatement program sends a significant amount of weeds down the canal system, into the drains and to the River. Therefore, while any proposed solution must prevent fish from entering the drains from the River, the solution must also allow the aquatic weeds to continue to flow to the River or remove the aquatic weeds in a cost-effective manner.",

		"Project Title": "Hygienic Design of Titano",
		"Background": "Turatti Group is a worldwide leader in food processing technology and a solutions provider for automation. Established in 1869, the group has been owned for five generations by the Turatti family, who infuses all operations with a commitment to innovation, social responsibility and providing cutting edge food processing solutions. For over seven decades the group is operating in North America, being the proud supplier of some of the major US and Canadian food processors. A 20,000 square foot state-of-the-art facility in Salinas, CA hosts the headquarters and manufacturing plants of Turatti North America. The operations manage the sales, services, support, and spare parts for the group, and represents other high-class solutions providers on robotics and automation for the US, Canadian, and Mexican markets.",
		"Problem": "The Titano multi-lane decorer is a flexible machine which can be adapted to many different products, providing a platform for coring, trimming, and cutting as required. Cutting units are available for decoring iceberg salad and cabbage, cutting head produce into multiple segments, cutting broccoli and cauliflower into florets, and other similar functions. The system is available in single lane or two lane models. The machine is provided with the appropriate infeed system for the product(s) being processed. The machine also includes the provision for separation of the cut/cored product into two product streams as required.  The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) is transforming the nation’s food safety system by shifting the focus from responding to foodborne illness to preventing it. Congress enacted FSMA in response to dramatic changes in the global food system and in our understanding of foodborne illness and its consequences, including the realization that preventable foodborne illness is both a significant public health problem and a threat to the economic well-being of the food system.  Although Turatti has been always highly committed to design and manufacture safe food processing equipment for any kind of operation, this new scenario welcomes the opportunity to review a very successful unit with an increased sanitary design. ",
		"Objectives": "The team need to review the recommendations like the ones of Joe Stout, former Director of Sanitation, Kraft Foods, and current President, Commercial Food Sanitation, that indicates that “the key goal of sanitary design principles is to increase the probability that every square inch of processing plant equipment can be properly cleaned to a microbiological and allergen-free level every day”. Besides this being the expectation from most customers in the industry today, the requirements for considering sanitary design criteria are contained within Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP’s), specifically Title 21 CFR parts 117.20 Plant and Grounds, 117.35 Sanitary Operations, 117.37 Sanitary Facilities and Controls, and 117.40 Equipment and Utensils. Incorporating hygienic design is thus a requirement of GMP’s in food production.  The team will review the current configuration of the system of the unit and of similar models available on the market. The team will be allowed to discuss with current customers and receive recommendations from the operation and sanitation team about the areas that are likely to be improved. The performance will be measured by the decreasing time required to sanitize the unit with the new configuration and with the process configuration basing it on the “less is more” principle. ",

		"Background": "The Wine Group is the country’s 2nd largest winery by volume, 3rd largest worldwide. TWG grows, processes, bottles and ships in excess of 50 million of cases a year. There are 10 wineries in California as far north as Sonoma and as far south as McFarland as well as wineries in Westfield New York and Loxton Australia. Since its establishment in 1981, TWG has emphasized establishing partnerships with surrounding local industry and university systems in order to foster positive growth within both the company and the community. This specific project focuses on the consolidation of data from 7 independent solar arrays at 4 of our TWG facilities in the San Joaquin Valley. ",
		"Problem": "The Wine Group has installed 5 solar arrays with 2 more under construction and anticipated in-service dates mid-way through 2019.  Each array has a web-based data monitoring system that gives system function alerts as well as live and historic performance reporting.  Each system was purchased with a performance guarantee that is supposed to be evaluated annually that compares theoretical performance and actual performance, and if out of agreed specifications a true-up occurs.  TWG also receives monthly invoices from PG&E and MID for power/Utility cost for each facility, some facilities have multiple meters.  The problem we face is that no one actually understands all aspects and sources of data available and we rarely can link billing, performance data, performance guarantee reporting without significant effort.  TWG does not have a sustainable solution to bridge the gap to easily produce repeatable and timely reports to satisfactorily answer inquiries on return on investment, accountability to performance guarantees etc. ",
		"Objectives": "The success criteria of this project would be to produce a tool or simplified process to gather billing information, monthly/annual performance data and time-based reminders to evaluate performance as compared to production guarantees. Envision a single source database type tool that could pull data or let user to enter identified data to produce a big picture solar performance. ",

		"Project Title": "Mechanical Solution for Neonatal CLABSI",
		"Background": "Central Line-Associated Blood Stream Infections (CLABSIs) is a primary laboratory confirmed bloodstream infection in a patient with a central line at the time of (or within 48-hours prior to) the onset of symptoms and the infection is not related to an infection from another site. Nearly 1 in 20 hospitalized patients acquire CLABSIs, which is considered one of the most deadly Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) yielding a 25% mortality rate.Central-lines are Central Venous Catheters (CVCs) that are inserted into large veins. CVCs support the survival of newborns and children in ICUs. They allow for multiple lines to be administered to the patient, which allow for medication delivery, measure blood pressure, and/or blood drawing without having to insert multiple needles. CVCs are inserted into the neck, chest, or groin. There are three types of CVCs: peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines, tunneled catheter and implanted port. In the NICU, PICCs and tunneled catheters are commonly used.",
		"Problem": "Despite its fundamental roles, CVCs carry the risk of complications, demanding both constant surveillance and care by healthcare professionals to prevent CLABSI, morbidity and mortality. It has been shown that CLABSI rates are reduced in idle CVCs lines compared to ones in use. Though there are multiple potential complications that can occur during the administration of these devices, the focus of this project will be on complications caused by bloodstream infections: (1) extraluminal and (2) intraluminal (e.g. catheter track and hub contamination, respectively).",
		"Objectives": "The objective of this project is to build on the success of last team. We want to focus on intraluminal sources of infection.  Success will be measured on how well the Central Line kit materials fit in the pen. We are open to redesigning aspects of the pen to accommodate the constraints of the new objective, but the function of the device must remain the same. Image of device pictured below.",

These products produce many by-product and potential by-product streams that are presently composted.  TF is headquartered in Salinas, CA but has operations spread across the USA and in Mexico where valued added produce items are produced. This activity falls between engineering and research.  This is an applied research project.",
		"Problem": "The present situation is more of an opportunity than a problem.  By-product and cull utilization are common ways to increase profitability.  There have been literature reports that broccoli protein would be a useful ingredient for manufacturing plant-based protein foods.  Broccoli contains other compounds of nutritional interest.  Most of these will be polyphenolics.  We would like to explore these and related opportunities to identify those that might be economically attractive opportunities. This work is speculative background to identify new product opportunities.  ",
		"Objectives": "Given that this is applied research, there is no guarantee of success. This effort may not identify any economically attractive opportunities.  However, we do expect the team to complete at least a survey of the protein levels and total phenolics levels of the actual and potential by-products associated with TF’s use of broccoli in this first effort.  If time permits, the team should pursue more detailed information regarding the constituents and their economic value.",

		"Project Title": "Mechanically Programmed Compression Device for T3Energy/SIGBT Highly Insulated Walls",
		"Background": "Super Insulated Green Building Technologies LLC (SIGBT) along with developing partner T3Energy of Australia, is currently working on development of new highly insulated and load bearing systems for residential wall construction. Current work uses wood shavings from construction offcut waste or sourced from bark beetle killed trees to manufacture a new composite material with above code insulation standards, while also engineering a result which is sufficiently structurally strong to act as load bearing external walls for new energy efficient homes. 30 new homes have been successfully built in Australia with a prototype of this new building system. The Australian Managing Director will be available to provide support and guidance by skype conferencing for this Capstone project. California based staff will also provide backup for the project.",
		"Problem": "Engineering modelling and testing of the tensioning arrangement for tie down rods which compress the High Thermal Insulation Wall Blocks together.  The individual High Thermal Insulation Wall Blocks are 24” long x 12” thick x 12” high. They have voids running through the blocks both vertically and horizontally. These blocks are not cemented together or held together by adhesive or filled with concrete. They are held together by 1/2”or 3/4” threaded rods running vertically through the voids in the blocks from the foundation to the roof structure. Seals between the blocks prevent any water or air leakage.  This is a system similar to that used to hold the sections of the iconic Sydney Opera House sails together where cables are inserted into voids in the precast concrete elements and tensioned through the adjoining element to compress the whole together.  At the top of the high thermal insulation wall a specially designed tension/compression plate (TC Plate) is installed which is shaped similar, but not identical to the horizontal void in the top of the blocks. Holes in the TC plate align with the position of the threaded tension rods.  As the threaded rods are tensioned by tightening lock nuts down the threaded rods on to the TC plate, the TC plate will bend progressively as tension is increased to the point where the TC plate conforms to the depth of the void in the top of the block. This process of bending the TC plate to the depth of the void in the top of the block is to be engineered to match the tension required in the tension rods to compress the wall together giving it the ability to resist building loads and forces generated by wind and seismic movement. This bending of the TC plate is engineered by selection of the thickness of the folded sheet metal section and by the amount of bending required of the TC plate to conform to the depth of top brick void. The tension plate therefore acts as a spring and tension gauge which can also accommodate some expansion and contraction in the tension rods due to temperature changes.  A tension plate with these characteristics will ensure that the correct tension is applied to all tension rods and is done so in a way which requires no measuring gauges or other specialist measuring technology on site, thereby simplifying and speeding the process of compressing the wall to the desired amount.  The brick and tension plate arrangement are illustrated on the attached images.  ",
		"Objectives": "This project requires the Capstone team to: 1) Model the design of the tension plate to determine a suitable thickness for the folded sheet metal tension plate and the degree to which the tension plate must bend to conform to the depth of the void.  2) Validate the modelling in 1) above by fabricating a full size tension plate and applying a measured tension to confirm that the tension plate operates as intended. Tension values required will be advised by T3Energy/SIGBT.",

This power supply design will need to generate enough power to run a few energy monitors on-site and be cost-effective. By introducing a modular, non-invasive power supply to industrial/commercial environments, this will allow for easier adoption of internet of things technologies and reduce installation times. Design must use power derived from non-invasive means such as Current Transformers or a similar technology as building wiring may not be modified. Secondary storage mechanism such as battery are also encouraged but must fit within predefined size constraints. Build, manufacture, and test for performance a prototype device of mechanical injection molded components, pcb assemblies and final product assembly.",

This successful commitment to safety has enabled the company to grow into a National organization to service our customers.",
		"Problem": "Drivers are completing Daily Vehicle Inspection Reports (DVIRs) daily for both power and trailing equipment.  When a defect is identified on the training equipment and the trailing equipment is swapped for another unit, the equipment with the defect is not communicated to the next driver who attaches the power unit to the defective trailing equipment.",
		"Objectives": "The objective of this project is to develop a mobile application that can be used with an iPhone and/or android device by the driver to complete the DVIR Pre and Post Trip Inspection Report for each vehicle (Tractor & Trailer).  Any DVIR with defects identified need to be communicated to the key stakeholders from the organization.  (DSL, SHE Mgr, ASL, Mechanic, Dickenson)  Once the defect has been communicated to the Mechanic and/or Repair Shop, the mechanic that fixes the defects must sign off as defects repaired and communication must be sent back to the next driver who uses the vehicle, at which time the driver must sign off after verifying the defect has been repaired.   All documentation must be retained for a period of 90-days. Our deliverable is to implement a mobile application for the driver’s use in the field and integrate the mobile application with the Repair Shop facility as well as the National Safety Compliance, Inc. Driver/Vehicle Management System Repository.",

		"Background": "The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center, located in the Arroyo Seco Mountains in Pasadena, CA. Originating as a laboratory of the California Institute of Technology, JPL has been in the aerospace industry since the 1920s. Dedicated to the unmanned exploration of the solar system, JPL has built interplanetary probes, orbiters, and landers to explore our universe and expand our knowledge.",
		"Problem": "Applications of heat transfer are ubiquitous in spacecraft applications. Examples are protecting the rocket engines from the hot exhaust used for propulsion, keeping sensitive electronics on board thermally insulated from the cold space, as well as protection from solar irradiation. In the 1970s, British hairdresser and amateur chemist Maurice Ward invented Starlite – a material with fantastic thermal properties. He demonstrated that a thin coating of this material could be charred with a blowtorch, but the other side would be cold enough to safely touch it. There was no description of how this material was made, and after Mr. Wards death, there is no knowledge of producing the material. Efforts to reinvent this material were made, but with minimal success.",
		"Objectives": "The recovery of Starlite would be a substantial advancement in space technologies. But with the information available, this material is short of ‘unobtaininum’, or an imaginary substance. The objective of this project is to research the feasibility, attempt the fabrication, and characterize this material. The material produced should have similar properties, but shall also be properly investigated and understood, such that future generations can produce it as well.",

Dedicated to the unmanned exploration of the solar system, JPL has built interplanetary probes, orbiters, and landers to explore our universe and expand our knowledge.",
		"Problem": "In situ resource utilization (ISRU) has become a critical part of space exploration. JPL’s upcoming mission to mars, the Mars 2020 rover will include an instrument to demonstrate the production of oxygen. MOXIE (Mars oxygen in situ experiment) uses a solid oxide electrolyzer to split carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and oxygen. While this technology was chosen for the mission, there are other ways to generate oxygen form carbon dioxide. The ability to scale oxygen generation for human missions (to make propellant and breathable oxygen) is especially important, and will require a thorough trade study. Assessing all technologies and finding the one option that fits all mission parameters will be critical for the success of human exploration of Mars.",
		"Objectives": "JPL is looking for alternative methods to generate oxygen using the Martian atmosphere. A previous study identified an alternative to electrolysis based generation (such as MOXIE), which is a viable candidate for larger production scales. This method is based on catalysis based oxidation-reduction reaction to generate oxygen. Not much research has done on different catalysts, especially operating at Martian conditions. The objective is to characterize and select the ideal catalyst for such reaction, and then demonstrate the production of oxygen in simulated Mars conditions.",

The two companies work together to sow the seeds needed for each season, as well as distributing & planting in the fields. ",
		"Problem": "The nursery closely monitors the health & growth status of 3 billion plants annually. Each seed sown, has the direct purpose of providing a certain weight of tomatoes. If plants do not grow, they do not produce tomatoes. This places large criticality as to the “yield” of each green-house, as it plays a large role into the overall plant count. Currently, hand labor is required to inspect each of the green houses, and perform a counting operation to determine if all of the seeds sown are growing into healthy tomato plants. Currently this takes a team of 3 people approximately 4 weeks to go through the entire green house and complete the count.",

		"Project Title": "Black Soldier Fly Larvae Drying",
		"Background": "HermetiaPro is an advanced sustainable-agriculture business. This company specializes in the biomass conversion of almond hulls and other agricultural co-products using Black Soldier Fly (BSF) insects. This conversion results primarily in the production of insect-derived proteins in the form of dried BSF larvae, as well as high-quality soil amendments. HermetiaPro is located in Fresno, California which allows them to utilize a variety of agricultural byproducts and co-products as naturally-sourced feedstocks for the production of insects. This geographical benefit is an enormous advantage due to the large amount of agriculture that takes place in the Central Valley. The specific activity at HermetiaPro that relates to this project is the drying process of adult BSF larvae.",
		"Problem": "HermetiaPro is searching for a more efficient method for drying the adult BSF larvae.  This is a problem for the company because it currently uses a batch-process method for drying, and in order to be scaled up sufficiently, this process needs to be converted into a continuous-flow process.  Solving this problem will allow HermetiaPro to produce dried BSF larvae at a much higher rate, yielding more revenue in a shorter amount of time.  The negotiable constraints include: how the larvae are euthanized (i.e. freezing, boiling, etc.), what type of machinery is used for processing and/or drying, what type of machinery is used for checking the moisture level, and the speed at which the process occurs. The non-negotiable constraints include: there has to be a pathogen kill step at a sufficient dwell time that ensures that potential pathogens (especially E.coli and Salmonella) are killed, the pathogen kill step can be incorporated into the drying process or it can be an additional step (but the larvae still have to have the ability to be able to be organically certified), the pathogen kill step must include data for each batch documenting how the pathogens have been sufficiently killed to meet regulations, the adult BSF larvae must be dried to a 6 to 10% moisture level, the solution has to work for various sized larvae without over drying, the process has to be continuous-flow, and the drying process has to be carried out in a manner that does not destroy the nutritional value of the larvae (i.e. proteins, amino acids, fatty acids, etc.)",
		"Objectives": "HermetiaPro would like the team to come up with a way to successfully euthanize and dry the adult BSF larvae in a continuous manner that preserves the nutrition of the larvae and maintains a 6 to 10% moisture level.  The team must also be able to sufficiently kill potential pathogens during the process as well as show documentation for each batch produced. At the end of the semester, HermetiaPro expects to see creative, innovative solutions, as well as a functioning prototype, and dried BSF larvae that meet the success criteria.  A successful solution should be able to properly euthanize the larvae, dry the adult BSF larvae to the specified moisture level without destroying the nutritional value, as well as confirm that the moisture level of the final product is within the specified range.  HermetiaPro will measure the performance of the teams product based on the teams ability to meet the successful solution criteria.",

This dust is removed from the interior prior to filling, but is not removed from the outside of the bottles. When the bottles are dried before labeling, the dust then saturates the air or collects around the area. This can be an irritant to employees working nearby, and poses a risk to the integrity of the equipment when significant fiber accumulates. ",
		"Objectives": "Design a system to remove fiber dust from empty bottles prior to interior air rinse. The system can use any plant utilities available in the area, and should be located between the single-filer and the air rinser. It should have some sort of dust collection system to prevent similar risks to the current situation. ",

		"Project Title": "Safe Hose Key",
		"Background": "E&J Gallo Winery crushes over 1,000,000 tons of grapes to make wine every year. To process this much juice into wine takes multiple movements that require large, heavy, sanitary hoses. The brass hose ends (couplings) are hooked up to stainless-steel pipe drops all over three main wineries (Fresno, Livingston, and Modesto). These connect tanks to processing equipment, or to other tanks for wine blending. To attach or detach these hoses to the pipe drops, employees called Rack & Blenders use a stainless-steel hose key. The hose key is similar to a DIN wrench, the difference is instead of a hook fastener, the hose key has two dimples that fit onto two brass ears. Hose connections are often tightly fastened, and can take much force to get on or off. The brass coupling ears wear over time, and in some cases, can become misshapen or smaller than the hose key dimples, which leads to a potential line-of-fire and ergonomic safety risk to employees.",
		"Problem": "Using the hose key with force could have the potential to create a risk to put the Rack & Blenders in the direct line-of-fire if the hose key slips off the brass ears. A creative solution is needed for a robust, ergonomic, and easy to use tool that can eliminate the risk of injury while performing this labor-intensive task. ",
		"Objectives": "The design and prototype needs to consider safety, ergonomics, sanitary design, and minimal capital investment and be presented with cost estimates, material details, and training. The design will be tested and approved by a Rack & Blender. ",

		"Background": "E & J Gallo Modesto’s Winery utilizes 400+ tanks to process and transfer wine.  The process of moving wine requires a detailed connection plan to provide instruction to our cellar operators.  Currently, this plan is generated by the MNFLD program, which is based on Dykstra’s graphing algorithm.  It provides baseline capability but does not meet our current needs. ",

		"Project Title": "Designing a Color Sorting Machine for Pistachio Kernels",
		"Background": "Agricultural Engineering Technology lab at UC Merced is located at Castle Research Facilities. It is leaded by Prof. Reza Ehsani and working on multiple, multidisciplinary projects related to application of new technology in food production. Lab is currently engaged in designing harvesting machines for olive and almond industries, designing/improving sorting machines for pistachio industry, detection of disease and bruise in fresh fruits, yield estimation, and detection of internal defects in dried agricultural/food products. This project falls under “designing/improving the efficiency of sorting machines for pistachio industry”.",
		"Problem": "Pistachio kernels are not unicolor. Each kernel has different tones of a wide range of colors (such as green, red, and yellow). Defected kernels appear in pale yellow, brown, black or barely grey. Kernels are sorted and graded and sold based on their grades (e.g. U.S. Fancy, U.S. Extra No.1, U.S. No.1, U.S. Select). U.S. Fancy has very low tolerance level for any kind of defects/damages. Kernel spotting is a factor that affects the price. Therefore, it is critical to detect and collect defected kernels. Pistachio processing is affected by defects and it is highly needed to reduce the number of defects (of any kind) in the final product. Students are expected to design a machine that can detect defects and the final kernel products meet the requirements of U.S. Fancy grade. ",
		"Objectives": "The team is expected: 1-To work on different detection and sorting methods (with the main focus on optical methods for detection of off-color kernels) 2-To design a machine that can detect defects (specifically color-defects) and separate defects form good kernels. It is expected to see a color sorting machine at the end of the semester. Performance of the team’s product will be measured by the actual performance of the machine under real condition (system will be loaded with pistachio kernels and the performance will be evaluated).",

		"Project Title": "Semi-Automatic Bottle Crester",
		"Background": "Since 1917 the Souza family has been farming sweet potatoes and rye in Atwater, California. Throughout the generations of farmers, the family has diversified the farm and innovated new practices into the sweet potato industry. In their 4th generation -- David J Souza founded the Corbin Cash distillery and continues his familys legacy of pioneers who bring sustainability, diversification, and love to their craft by making the first sweet potato vodka. David soon enough produced a full line of farm to bottle spirits that are named after his son- Corbin Cash.  The distillery currently produces 5 spirits, all of which have our custom designed bottle with a signature family crest. The metallic crest is applied by hand. This application process is significantly time consuming since bottles must be taken out of their packaging, laid down, have glue applied, the crest applied, the crest straightened, must sit for 20 minutes to let the glue dry, and then put back into their packaging for future bottling.",
		"Problem": "The team will be tasked to provide an alternative method of applying the crests to the bottles. The crests must be applied straight with little to no margin for error since a paper label wraps tightly around the crest with less than ¼ of clearance. The goal is to have the crest applied with the correct orientation in a semi-automatic or automatic process that significantly reduces the amount of time and labor required. ",
		"Objectives": "Corbin Cash expects students to collaborate together and with management to fully understand the problem but encourages and expects creativity, self-discipline, and personal growth from every individual student. Ideally, a fully functional solution is desired to be in use as soon as possible. At a minimum, the team must present a prototype and full completed design by the end of their project that is both feasible and easy to implement.",

		"Project Title": "Vodka Filtration System",
		"Background": "Since 1917 the Souza family has been farming sweet potatoes and rye in Atwater, California. Throughout the generations of farmers, the family has diversified the farm and innovated new practices into the sweet potato industry. In their 4th generation -- David J Souza founded the Corbin Cash distillery and continues his familys legacy of pioneers who bring sustainability, diversification, and love to their craft by making the first sweet potato vodka. David soon enough produced a full line of farm to bottle spirits that are named after his son- Corbin Cash. The distillery currently produces spirits for its own brand and is also responsible for the production of other private label companies. Vodka is one of the largest sellers and is also currently used for the production of gin, and is sold to various private label clients.",
		"Problem": "In a recent innovation, the filtration method used to carbon filter vodka has been radically changed. The previous filtration system is of no use and a new one is needed. Vodka is currently being filtered in a gravity filtration process that requires constant supervision and does not give a constant flow rate. The goal is to create a brand-new vodka filtration system that minimizes losses, cuts production time and reduces the labor required. The number one constraint is that the flavor profile of the vodka must be consistent!  If successful, this will cut down production times for vodka, significantly reducing cost and increasing our maximum production output.",
		"Objectives": "Corbin Cash expects students to collaborate closely with the Lead Distiller to fully understand the constraints of vodka filtrations, and needs for the system but encourages and expects creativity, self-discipline, and personal growth from every individual student. Ideally, a fully functional system is desired to be in use by August 2019. At a minimum, the team must present a prototype and full completed design by the end of their project that is feasible and easy to implement.",

The wastewater is treated through preliminary screening, primary treatment, activated sludge, tertiary process, and anaerobic digestion. The specific related project is purification of the digester methane gas to compressed natural gas (CNG) fuel source that can be utilized as a beneficial reuse or renewable source",
		"Problem": "The wastewater treatment process generates methane, most of which is currently flared. It would be beneficial to make use of the energy in the methane either for electricity generation, for a heating application, and/or for transportation. The team is asked to brainstorm uses for how the methane could be treated and utilized. The team will develop and present an analysis of available options, i.e. renewable energy credits or reuse within the City of Merced refuse department as a fuel source for trash collection. Interruption of the anaerobic process during the study phase will not be an issue. Work and data collection can be completed during full operation of the biological process. As the project comes to an end, ideas may be implemented that will provide a renewable resource to the city. Negotiable items are staff time and city resources. Non-negotiable issues, such as safety concerns, i.e. personal protective equipment (PPE), confined space entry, equipment or instrument use on site and possible access to certain areas, will all have to be preapproved. Documentation of training will be provided before project implementation. ",
		"Objectives": "Success of the project would be providing the client with an understanding of viable options that could be considered as a beneficial renewable energy project and the advantages and disadvantages of each option. The metrics include the upfront cost of the installation and the ongoing cost savings over the lifetime of the project. The metrics will be provided as a part of the project conclusion. The performance measurement will be the cost of the project implementation along with equipment life expectancy and associated preventative maintenance cost schedule. User end results will be the determination of how effective the project returns will be to the city.",

		"Problem": "Milkweed is a native species in the California’s Central Valley and is a critical element in Monarch habitat, as it provides both forage for adult butterflies and protection for developing larvae.  With changes in California land use pressures, milkweed populations have declined, contributing to a correlating decline in monarch populations.  Milkweed seed is naturally distributed via pappus (like a dandelion) and when collected, is a mixture of floss and seed.  Today, most milkweed is collected by hand, which is a costly and inefficient process.  New methods need to be developed for both harvesting and cleaning milkweed seeds in order to efficiently meet the habitat demands of the species.",
		"Objectives": "Milkweed harvesting is the most intensive effort in the production.  Milkweed seed is most often collected by hand, and occasionally, via combine.  There are significant disadvantages to both.  Hand collection of milkweed seed is cost-prohibitive when considering the environmental demands, and combining seed results in the collection of immature materials and can damage the milkweed plants.  A successful solution should (1) be mechanized, (2) minimize damage to milkweed plants, and (3) be scalable.",

		"Project Title": "Livestock Waterer",
		"Background": "The client are ranchers and farmers who raise livestock. They are located in the United States and they raise and feed livestock outdoors year around. The goal is to pasture graze in remote fields in all weather with no water or electricity provided.",
		"Problem": "The client needs to provide water to livestock in remote locations off the grid (no water or electricity.) Without a well or electricity they are unable to supply 250 gallons or more to livestock for 24 hours. With this product they will be able to manage larger herds with less employees and increase profit. Has to be able to be towed with a vechicle at highway speeds with tires that can disperse weight without createing ruts in soft ground. With solar/battery or wind power it must heat or recirculate water to keep water from freezing in the winter (-30F). It must have the ability to provide at least 250 gallons of water per day. The water trough must be accessible to shorter livestock so it can not be taller than eighteen inches from ground level. Would be better if it is high quality and low maintenance and have a long product lifespan. Would like to be UV and inclement weather resistant. Would like to see parts that are easily replaceable. Would like to see a product that was not easily damaged by large livestock (1,200 pounds.)",
		"Objectives": "Provide a design or a working prototype of the product described above. A complete product is preferred but designs are acceptable. Performance will be measured on how many constraints the product/design is within, thus solving more problems the client has.",

TruckAlert is a prototype app for truckers to report problems on the road by recognizing and classifying their voice notes and commands via mobile phones legally while driving, and be alerted via voice within a desired distance.",
		"Problem": "Truckers inherently rely on truck navigation systems, and would enormously benefit from real-time information, because any change causes much bigger problems, delays, and costs than to cars. Apps like Google Maps and Waze crowdsource data on traffic, obstacles, and police, though they may not indicate information that would be useful to truckers, such as: weight limits, height limits, truck stops, closed lanes, road damage, toll roads, etc. More importantly, current applications require multiple interactions with the smartphone screen, which is illegal (current law in the USA allows one touch to truckers, originating from the button of CBS radios).",
		"Objectives": "TruckAlert captures voice commands from mobile devices with the geo-location and time from GPS, aggregates the events in a searchable central database, and reports events via voice or on a map the events matching the desired settings. Work with the Google Maps API (or truck routing apps) so that only obstacles along the planned route are shown in search results, rather than a simple radius. Can also provide alternative routes with hooks into Google Maps API (or truck routing apps / computers). Guess which off ramp (by number, coordinates, etc.) is closed based on geographical proximity when a user reports exit closed or similar. Allow for more precise results in search.",

		"Project Title": "Vehicle Vibration Analysis",
		"Background": "As part of regular track inspection and maintenance, BART operates several types of vehicles on its right-of-way during non-revenue service hours (approximately 1:00 AM – 4:00 AM daily). One such vehicle, a powered flat, is a fixed rail flatcar that provides its own locomotion and can be fitted with cranes, scissor lifts, and other equipment. These vehicles are indispensable to system operations as they allow people, parts, and tools to be moved along the trackway without the need for a separate locomotive or power generator.",
		"Problem": "As useful as BART’s powered flats are, they have a tendency to become unstable and bounce up and down (sometimes called “porpoising”) when they approach 17 miles per hour, well below their ideal top speed of 25 miles per hour. This effect is the result of a vehicle instability, but identifying and eliminating its cause is difficult because of the dozens of variables affecting vehicle dynamics. The powered flats are comprised of many different interlocking parts, and very small adjustments to their size and positioning can result in major changes in the overall system response.",
		"Objectives": "This project will consist of two phases, spanning two semesters and carried out by different teams.The Phase 1 team will develop an instrumentation set for vibration analysis, collect live vibration data,perform basic data processing, and clearly define the instability. The goal of this phase is to pinpoint the location or locations of the vehicle’s troublesome components by determining where, when, and at what frequency vibrations are occurring. The end product for Phase 1 will be a report characterizing the vehicle’s instability and identifying the most likely causes of the unwanted movement. In Phase 2, a second team will develop a computer-based model of the powered flat, then perform an analysis of possible vehicle alterations to reduce or eliminate instability (see Innovate to Grow: Maintenance Vehicle Vibration Analysis and Design Modification – Phase 2 for more information on Phase 2).  The development of effective data capturing and processing tools during Phase 1, as well as skillful communication of the team’s findings, will lay essential groundwork for Phase 2. The vibration data collection tools/sensor system should be designed with ease of use, maintainability, durability, reliability, and accuracy as key design criteria. This is an exciting opportunity to help solve a real-world problem faced by BART’s Maintenance & Engineering (M&E) staff and will greatly improve the safety and efficiency of maintenance operations. Computer science, materials science, and mechanical engineering students are especially encouraged to take part in this important project.",

		"Project Title": "Tracking Inspection Apparatus",
		"Background": "BART maintains over 121 miles of track comprising six lines spread over four counties. The system provides service to over 400,000 average daily riders and is a vital piece of the Bay Area’s transportation infrastructure. Although system components are built for strength and longevity, normal wear and tear is unavoidable. This is especially true as increased ridership—BART carries more than ten times as many passengers as it did in the early 1970s—takes its toll on equipment, structures, trains, and track. As part of BART’s commitment to safe and efficient service, tracks and their components are inspected for misalignment, cracks, fractures, corrosion, wear, and other defects and damage. ",
		"Problem": "Track inspections occur during non-revenue service hours, which has some drawbacks: because the work can only be done within a limited window each night, coordinating with staff schedules can be difficult and reduced visibility increases the potential for human error. Furthermore, any use of personnel on the trackway carries a certain amount of risk to worker safety.",
		"Objectives": "BART is looking for innovative ideas to address the difficulties of nighttime track inspections. How can the process be made safer and more efficient? Can the current system be improved, augmented, or redesigned to meet these goals? Is there a way to reduce the need for inspection staff along the right-of-way, or can technology be developed to make on-site human involvement unnecessary? The proposed solution must have the ability to travel along BART’s nonstandard (5’ 6” gage) rail lines quickly and safely, as well as observe and detect problem areas. It must then note, flag, record, and report issues back to technical staff in a timely and accurate manner. The system may include the use of automated or robotic devices equipped with cameras, sensors, or other tools to detect defects and damage to the trackway. These devices could operate alongside or be remotely controlled by inspectors. Finally, the proposed solution should be reliable, resilient, simple to maintain, and represent an improvement on current maintenance processes. Mechanical and computer science engineering students will find this to be an exciting and rewarding chance to develop innovative ideas, learn valuable skills, and help improve the operations of a vital public transport system.",

		"Project Title": "Odor Abatement",
		"Background": "As the public’s first point of entry into the BART system, passenger stations are some of BART’s most prominent physical features. In addition to transit-facing spaces such as ticketing zones, concourses, and platforms, many stations also contain open, outdoor areas that fulfill some of the same functions as public parks—places where community members meet, spend time, and participate in neighborhood life. ",
		"Problem": "Though BART works to maintain these public spaces in line with community standards of cleanliness and safety, upkeep is a constant challenge. Exposure to the elements plus normal wear and tear combine with vandalism, littering, and other consequences of heavy use to make cleaning a near-constant job. Garbage and grime create unpleasant odors, are an eyesore, and are a potential biohazard risk to patrons and staff.",
		"Objectives": "This project will continue an effort begun last year to mitigate the effects of uncleanliness and contamination in BART plazas, with an emphasis on odor abatement. In fall 2018, the UC Merced team proposed a machine to draw in outside air, run it through deodorizing liquid, and spray a fine mist of fresh air into the surrounding area. Concepts and schematics were developed, and a simulation was conducted to determine the machine’s maximum odor-reducing range in an enclosed environment. However, the simulation did not take into account all the variables of a large open-air plaza, and the system has not yet been implemented. This project will expand on the work done last fall, with the new team building a prototype of the odor removal system and running additional tests to determine its effective range in BART’s public plazas. Modifications to the fall 2018 team’s recommendation to eliminate unpleasant odors or a new machine may also be developed. The new proposal must be innovative, economical, and effective. It must also be designed to withstand the test of time, and not put undue burden on maintenance resources in the futur  —dependability, sturdiness, and ease of use should be prioritized. This project will be of interest to all engineering students, with those studying mechanical engineering particularly encouraged to participate.",

		"Background": "When most people think of BART, what first comes to mind are the trains. However, one element of BART’s infrastructure that is often overlooked does not run on elevated platforms or in underground tunnels, but in between the two: sidewalks and other ground-level paved surfaces. ",
		"Problem": "BART works hard to maintain these surfaces. But over time, they can become damaged due to heavy loads as well as natural phenomena like tree roots and seismic activity. The resulting cracks, unevenness, and sloped planes are then a safety risk to riders and staff alike. Surface defects must be repaired to prevent tripping and allow the maneuverability of wheelchairs and other wheeled conveyances to meet Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) guidelines. BART takes the safety and accessibility of its facilities very seriously, and ease of access for people with disabilities is of particular importance.",
		"Objectives": "This project will address the problem of uneven and cracked paved surfaces in and around BART stations and facilities. The successful solution will be innovative, cost effective, and robust, with a focus on durability and ease of future maintenance. The solution will also need to enhance and be easily incorporated into existing maintenance practices, and take into account the full range of ground surface materials employed at BART sites including concrete, tile, brick, and asphalt. The proposal may utilize substances or machinery to patch, wedge, grind, or cut the paved surfaces in order to temporarily or permanently fix the problem. However, it cannot simply consist of a recommendation for off-the-shelf equipment or materials; in keeping with the spirit of Innovate to Grow, the project must showcase creativity, originality, and engineering abilities. This project will be of particular interest to students in mechanical and materials science engineering who are looking to gain industry experience and hone their technical and problem solving skills. The successful team will help solve a real problem of immense importance to all in the BART community—one that often goes unnoticed, despite being literally underneath our feet.",

		"Project Title": "Track Obstruction Detection",
		"Background": "Since the early 1970s, BART has provided passengers with fast, reliable, and safe transportation throughout both the Bay Areas urban core and lower-density outlying areas. The system encompasses 121 miles of track, of which 32 miles are aerial, 61 miles are at grade and about 28 miles underground. ",
		"Problem": "With such an extensive wayside network, BART faces the constant challenge of maintaining track clearance and functionality, particularly along uncovered outdoor routes. Track obstructions such as tree branches and garbage pose fire hazards and can cause the train control system to register the presence of a nonexistent train on the trackway, known as a false occupancy. Avoidance of operational delays is critical. Other obstructions include stray animals—and even the occasional human—trespassing wayside. Although relatively rare, these occurrences delay service, causing late arrivals and missed transit connections for passengers.",
		"Objectives": "The goal of this project is to improve BARTs ability to manage track obstructions via an apparatus or procedure that reduces the time taken to detect and address these issues. The focus will be on aerial and at-grade track. As part of the successful completion of this effort, the project team will deliver both a functional prototype and a report describing the technology involved. The report must provide comprehensive specifications including the following: accuracy—how  accurate and precise the detection mechanism is; Speed—both how fast the mechanism deploys and the speed at which inspection is carried out; obstruction type—what kinds of objects would be identified; range; maintainability ease of use and dependability; and financial impact to BART operations. This project provides a unique opportunity to assist BART in its ongoing efforts to provide the safest and most efficient transit services possible for its riders. Computer science and mechanical engineering students are encouraged to join this exciting project.",

		"Project Title": "Autonomous Dozer Control",
		"Background": "Topcon Positioning Systems is a company which makes innovative products for the construction and agriculture market. A large portion of products is dedicated to do automatic precise blade control of machines such as the dozer and grader. This means that operators of such machines no longer need to be highly skilled. The company’s offices are located in Livermore, CA. There are several R&D projects being developed by the Livermore Engineering department, and one of them is an autonomous dozer, also known as the Sambuca project. The Autonomous Dozer control app is an important part of the Sambuca project.",
		"Problem": "The Autonomous Dozer does not have a cabin. The customer will set tasks and track the dozer operation through the tablet/phone app. At the very least the customer must have a view of what’s happening in front of the truck, and have some simple control over machine through the app (turn right, left, forward, backward, etc.)",
		"Objectives": "The Autonomos Dozer app will receive a videostream from the dozer controller (a ROS box).There are going to be several videostreams being transmitted upon request: camera view, camera view with objects tracked, lidar view, and etc. The app should output a selected stream and provide the option to select another stream. Customer should touch the screen (to highlight/track selected object selected). App must send screen coordinates (X,Y) back to Dozer controller (ROS box), so controller can later identify which object was selected. App must provide simple joystick interface for the dozer to go left/right/forwards/backwards. The app will interact with Dozer Controller (ROS box) over the WiFi. The controller will be running ROS framework.  The API will be based on ROS publisher/subscriber model and/or a proprietary Topcon command interface.  The videostream will be given by ROS (UDP packets). Topcon will provide a stereocamera and a laptop with ROS installed to run Dozer controller software. Lidar data will be provided along with it to make it possible to receive a point cloud as a videostream. The app must establish a connection with ROS software. The app must be run on the phone, establish the connection with ROS software be able to switch different videostreams, select the X,Y coordinates of the screen and send back information on what buttons the user has pressed. To succeed is to have a working, stable app with an acceptable look and feel.",

This specific activity this project supports our internal warehouse logistics, the process flow from finished cases (pallets) off of multiple bottling lines to on-site warehouse(s) where finished products are stored, and trucks loaded for shipment to our distributors. ",

The team would map current process flows and then identify opportunities to minimize the number of times pallets are handled, recommend process changes, product flow, potential changes in output and intake areas,  The Wine Group needs to optimize storage capacity, maintain product integrity and attempt to reduce cost in product handling.  TWG recently completed a 510,000 sqft addition to its 200,000 sqft on-site warehouse. The challenges posed are complex as there exist tribal habits of a process flow that may be inefficient, production lines that have recently been built in locations where lines did not exist. With all of these changes, the mid-level managers have not had the time to step back and dedicate time to observe and present process flow options that may improve efficiencies across the organization. TWG Manufacturing and Warehouse logistics operations can benefit greatly by utilization of storage that supports a more just-in-time production and shipping schedule.   The Wine Group has explored modern “fully automated-warehouse” concepts, these are not realistic options for TWG due to inherent packaging constraints.  TWG is very open to partial automation, process routing, warehouse storage layout. ",

		"Background": "SmartWash Solutions (SW) is a wholly owned subsidiary of Taylor Farms.  Taylor Farms is a major player in the ready to eat produce category.  SW provides food safety technology to this business category. Included in the food safety offerings are systems for controlling wash water chemistry to improve the hygiene and therefore the safety of these products. For more information see http://smartwashsolutions.com/. SW is located in Salinas, CA where the wash adjuvants are prepared, the equipment assembled, and research is conducted including experiments in a full-scale pilot plant. The Salinas facility also houses the field support personnel.  This activity falls between engineering and research.  It is an applied research project.",
		"Problem": "Sodium hypochlorite solutions accumulate chlorates as a by-product as a function of time and temperature. SW would like technology to remove these chlorates at the point of use from concentrated (normally 10-12% w/w) sodium hypochlorite solutions.   Towards this end, we would like the team to demonstrate proof of concept for an affordable scalable process.  SW anticipates that a successful project will lead to a new product offering. Given that this process will be used in a food washing operation, it must comply with all FDA regulations.  It will also hopefully be compatible with international rules.  It must be affordable so that it can be deployed where chlorine is used.  Total costs should add less than $0.10/gallon to the cost of the Sodium hypochlorite.  Greater costs will drive the industry back to using chlorine gas where chlorates are not of concern.  We anticipate an electrochemical solution but are open to other approaches.  Previous work shows that ion exchange has some potential but probably will fall short of being affordable.  ",
		"Objectives": "Given that this is applied research, success is not a certainty.  We expect the team to determine the feasibility of an electrochemical solution for the reduction of chlorates without reducing the hypochlorite ions to chloride.  If successful and time permits, the economics of this process should be evaluated and plans suggested for optimization.  ",

		"Problem": "The shipping process is the final step as product leaves the company and has many avenues of distribution including truck and rail. Specifically, the rail spurs located at Williams facility, services approximately 60 rail cars loaded & shipped out every day. The expectation is that we will expand by a factor of 2 (double). With this plan for expansion, the increasing price in rental forklifts & experienced labor make it difficult to compete in the commodity market. Morning Star is looking to an advantage to help reduce cost & improve the total pounds shipped per man hour.",
		"Objectives": "Provide Research report on available technologies to load a rail car. Perform economic analysis & report on top 3 technologies, including benefits to the company. Provide final recommendation of technology & 3 vendors who Morning Star might be able to work with in delivering a solution. Provide path to solution, as liaison to initial quoting process with the recommended vendor.",

		"Project Title": "Ag sensors",
		"Background": "G3 Enterprises is an industry leader in beverage packaging and logistics located in Modesto, CA. We provide integrated packaging solutions from grape to glass to a wide variety of wine and spirits customers. Our activities range from the manufacture of packaging materials such as screwcaps, corks, and labels to the transportation of grapes, juice, and wine to consulting with packaging lines to help solve problems or increase efficiencies. G3 serves a broad range of customers in the Beverage and Agriculture industries, including wines & spirits, beers, cider & coffee, and specialty beverages & food. We are committed to adopting environmentally sound practices and products. Our processes strive to minimize waste, maximize the use of materials, and conserve resources. Our belief is that a healthy environment is critical to a successful business. We operate with the highest ethical standards to ensure that we achieve excellence while nurturing and protecting our land.",
		"Problem": "G3 is investigating how to help our grape growers become more efficient and environmentally sustainable in their vineyard practices. Quality data regarding vineyard conditions is vital to making good grape-growing management decisions. Currently, many vineyards rely on people to observe conditions and make decisions based upon these observations, which are often insufficient. With accurate information readily available to the vineyard managers, grapes could be grown at higher quality and yields. This information can be generated from data sent by sensors in the field. For this technology to work, these sensors need to be compatible with environmental conditions typically found in vineyard environments. They also need to be energy efficient and transmit data wirelessly to a repository. We are looking for an economical insect or mold sensor design that is robust to real world vineyard conditions, requires low energy and able to wirelessly transmit data to a gateway for storage, transformation, and distribution. A pest detection sensor with these capabilities would allow the real-time tracking of pest problems resulting in the efficient and more environmentally sustainable elimination of the issue using minimal treatment chemicals. The sensor would also minimize the need for human scouting and evaluation of the extent of the pest infestation. This is turn will likely result in higher quality fruit, better yield, and more profits.",
		"Objectives": "Design of a robust wireless sensor that can detect directly or through predictive analytics the presence, severity and location of vineyard insect pests or mold/mildew disease. These sensors should be battery powered or, even better, powered by energy harvesting technologies. By the end of the semester, G3 expects a viable sensor design and possibly a prototype. Theoretical performance of the design, or field testing of the prototype, will determine how well the team performed.",

		"Background": "E & J Gallo Modesto’s Winery runs over 125MM bottles with a cap across the entire Modesto Bottling Room. The caps are applied on the line and are susceptible to material variation, which can potentially lead to defects. During the troubleshooting process for this defect the teams currently have a difficult time measuring the material, specifically glass measurements, which leads to longer troubleshooting and more downtime.  ",
		"Problem": "The current Go-No Go gauges are hard to use and subjective.",
		"Objectives": "Design one or more gauges that eliminate the “subjectivity” of our current gauges. The gauge will need to be able to identify if one of three critical measurements are out of spec. ",

Removal of the plastic must be done smoothly and delicately to prevent bottles from falling from the unit.

The design should be focused on improving ergonomics while avoiding adding time needed to remove plastic.  The design(s) should have a complete cost estimate for implementation.",

		"Background": "Bowles Farming Company is a sixth generation family farm out of Los Banos CA. Bowles continuously strives to implement new technology to improve processes and activities around the farm.  ",
		"Problem": "Milkweed is a native species in the California’s Central Valley and is a critical element in Monarch habitat, as it provides both forage for adult butterflies and protection for developing larvae.  With changes in California land use pressures, milkweed populations have declined, contributing to a correlating decline in monarch populations.  Milkweed seed is naturally distributed via pappus (like a dandelion) and when collected, is a mixture of floss and seed.  Today, most milkweed is collected by hand, which is a costly and inefficient process.  New methods need to be developed for both harvesting and cleaning milkweed seeds in order to efficiently meet the habitat demands of the species.",
		"Objectives": "After collection, milkweed seed is often cleaned by hand, combine, or simple mechanical means. These processes are extremely laborious, are not scalable, and often fail to protect the frail seeds or collect clean floss (pappus), which has auxiliary uses in the textile industry.  A cleaning system is needed which can run continuously, processing large quantities of seed and floss.  This process should both (1) protect the seed and (2) collect floss and maintain its quality.",

		"Background": "Bowles Farming Company is a sixth generation family farm out of Los Banos CA. Bowles continuously strives to implement new technology to improve processes and activities around the farm.  ",
		"Problem": "California monarch populations have been plummeting, experiencing a mind-numbing 86% decline in a single year.    Due to the transient nature of the species and its sparse population, tracking the species is both increasingly challenging and increasingly critical.  Technological advancements in image recognition may provide a helpful key in providing landscape level tools to track monarchs in the State.  Monarch recognition cameras may aid in providing timely data to inform on populations, densities, and migration patterns throughout the state.  This data would likely prove highly actionable in tracking areas of importance to inform habitat restoration and conservation efforts.",
		"Objectives": "Create method of deploying multiple cameras/sensors to detect monarchs and report on the detections to a centralized database. Devise method of displaying relevant data on a timeline so as users can see when the population densities are highest. Implement some form of reporting so other agencies/researchers would be able to access the data as well.",

TruckAlert is a prototype app for truckers to report problems on the road by recognizing and classifying their voice notes and commands via mobile phones legally while driving, and be alerted via voice within a desired distance.",
		"Problem": "Truckers inherently rely on truck navigation systems, and would enormously benefit from real-time information, because any change causes much bigger problems, delays, and costs than to cars. Apps like Google Maps and Waze crowdsource data on traffic, obstacles, and police, though they may not indicate information that would be useful to truckers, such as: weight limits, height limits, truck stops, closed lanes, road damage, toll roads, etc. More importantly, current applications require multiple interactions with the smartphone screen, which is illegal (current law in the USA allows one touch to truckers, originating from the button of CBS radios).",
		"Objectives": "TruckAlert captures voice commands from mobile devices with the geo-location and time from GPS, aggregates the events in a searchable central database, and reports events via voice or on a map the events matching the desired settings. Implementation of a behind the scenes system for giving each user some amount of reputation and assign weights to the respective alert; guessing whether or not obstacles are legitimate and still valid, and prompting other users to confirm in order to keep an accurate database at all times. It should favor re-routing trucks only when a reported obstacle is likely or verified. ",

		"Background": "TruckAlert is a startup project supported by Bihai Empreendimentos e Participações Ltda in Brasil. TruckAlert is a prototype app for truckers to report problems on the road by recognizing and classifying their voice notes and commands via mobile phones legally while driving, and be alerted via voice within a desired distance.",
		"Problem": "Truckers inherently rely on truck navigation systems, and would enormously benefit from real-time information, because any change causes much bigger problems, delays, and costs than to cars. Apps like Google Maps and Waze crowdsource data on traffic, obstacles, and police, though they may not indicate information that would be useful to truckers, such as: weight limits, height limits, truck stops, closed lanes, road damage, toll roads, etc. More importantly, current applications require multiple interactions with the smartphone screen, which is illegal (current law in the USA allows one touch to truckers, originating from the button of CBS radios).",
		"Objectives": "TruckAlert captures voice commands from mobile devices with the geo-location and time from GPS, aggregates the events in a searchable central database, and reports events via voice or on a map the events matching the desired settings. Use some form of basic Natural Language Processing to better interpret commands to the TruckAlert application. This will allow for less restrictive use of voice commands . Could be as complex as machine learning to guess intent, or as simple as a library that strips out extra words and/or guesses intent, as well as separates numbers from sentences for input handling. i.e. ten miles into 10 and miles.

		"Project Title": "Design a Flat Vehicle",
		"Background": "As part of regular track inspection and maintenance, BART operates several types of vehicles on its right-of-way during non-revenue service hours (approximately 1:00 AM – 4:00 AM daily). One such vehicle, a powered flat, is a fixed rail flatcar that provides its own locomotion and can be fitted with cranes, scissor lifts, and other equipment. These vehicles are indispensable to system operations as they allow people, parts, and tools to be moved along the trackway without the need for a separate locomotive or power generator.",
		"Problem": "As useful as BART’s powered flats are, they have a tendency to become unstable and bounce up and down (sometimes called “porpoising”) when they approach 17 miles per hour, well below their ideal top speed of 25 miles per hour. This effect is the result of a vehicle instability, but identifying and eliminating its cause is difficult because of the dozens of variables affecting vehicle dynamics. The powered flats are comprised of many different interlocking parts, and very small adjustments to their size and positioning can result in major changes in the overall system response.",
		"Objectives": "This project will consist of two phases, spanning two semesters and carried out by different teams. In Phase 1 data will be collected and processed in order to pinpoint where and how the vehicle is vibrating (see Innovate to Grow: Maintenance Vehicle Vibration Analysis and Design Modification – Phase 1 for more information on Phase 1). Using the Phase 1 report identifying the likely cause(s) of the unwanted vibration as a starting point, the Phase 2 team will develop a design for a better powered flat. Possible tools for achieving this may include a computer-based dynamic model, where data gathered in the first phase is used as input parameters for model validation, followed by an iterative model-based analysis of possible alterations to reduce or eliminate vehicle instability. The second phase’s final product will be a report recommending cost effective vehicle design modifications to address the issue of unwanted vibration. Design modifications should prioritize ease of maintenance, reliability, durability and simplicity. This effort will build upon the work done in Phase 1 and will demand innovation, diligence, and cooperation to turn vibration data into a practical solution. This is an exciting opportunity to help solve a real-world problem faced by BART’s Maintenance & Engineering (M&E) staff and will greatly improve the safety and efficiency of maintenance operations. Computer science, materials science, and mechanical engineering students are especially encouraged to take part in this important project. ",

		"Project Title": "New System for Monthly Fire Extinguisher Inspections",
		"Background": "The BART system contains approximately 121 miles of track spread across four counties, encompassing 48 passenger stations and many other facilities. As part of its comprehensive fire protection system, BART maintains over 4,100 fire extinguishers throughout this network. Each one of these must be inspected on a monthly basis to ensure their physical integrity, accessibility, and fullness per National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) requirements. ",
		"Problem": "Although BARTs maintenance staff diligently keeps up with the monthly inspections, the sheer number of units makes this a time-consuming task. In the interest of more efficiently deploying its workforce to address maintenance needs where and when they arise, BART has long sought a way to expedite the fire extinguisher inspection process.",
		"Objectives": "The goal of this project is to develop an innovative, cost-effective method of quickly checking fire extinguishers for their continuous functionality. The proposed system must require only a visual check to ascertain tank fullness, as opposed to currently available options which require heating or wetting of the unit. It is also imperative that extinguishers can be fully inspected while mounted in place, without any lifting or moving. The ideal solution will alert staff when a fire extinguisher is stolen or missing, and will be simple enough that future use and maintenance can be conducted easily and efficiently. BARTs fire protection system is one of the key building blocks of its extensive safety program, and fire extinguishers play an integral role in the system’s commitment to the well-being of all riders and staff. This project presents an opportunity to apply knowledge of technology, materials science, mechanical and other engineering disciplines as well as a spirit of innovative problem solving to a key practical challenge. The result will be a solution that delivers markedly increased efficiency, allowing BART to redirect resources to other vital system needs.",

		"Project Title": "Pigeon mitigation",
		"Background": "BART’s 48 passenger stations are critical points of departure, arrival, and transfer for millions of transit riders across the Bay Area each year. They also function as community hubs for locals and visitors alike, anchoring civic, retail, and residential zones and serving as neighborhood landmarks in their own right.",
		"Problem": "Unfortunately, pigeons—like their human counterparts— find the stations (and BART’s numerous electrical substations and maintenance facilities) to be ideal community meeting places. The birds not only create an unpleasant atmosphere for patrons, they present a potential biohazard for BART staff, particularly in confined work spaces. They also inflict lasting damage on equipment. Although BART has tried several solutions over the years, none so far has struck the right balance between aesthetic appeal and successful resolution of the problem.",
		"Objectives": "The goal of this project is to innovate an effective, environmentally friendly, humane, and visually pleasing pigeon abatement solution for BART stations and facilities. Past efforts have utilized wire, netting, and other physical deterrents to unsatisfactory effect. The successful approach to this challenge may involve physical, material, chemical, or even acoustic interventions. At the same time, care must be taken to ensure that the birds are not harmed. Specific problem areas include parking lot lighting, signage, concrete walls, platforms, and other exposed surfaces. One of BART’s foremost goals is to provide clean, comfortable, functional spaces for riders and staff, whether they are spending extended periods of time in the system or just passing through. Although by and large this goal is realized, pigeon abatement is an area where work remains to be done. This project offers an opportunity to shape the next generation of sustainable and attractive solutions to an issue of importance to the health, safety, and quality of life of all BART stakeholders. Those majoring in materials or environmental science, mechanical or biological engineering, and related disciplines are encouraged to lend their knowledge and skills to this innovative opportunity.",

The field run nuts refer the inhull nuts transferred to a trailer delivered to a huller/sheller. Effectively separating and removing the debris at orchard sites will reduce the field run weight by transportation, hence, the lower transportation cost to hauling the debris in and out. This will also generate cleaner field run nuts and less foreign materials for a hulling/hulling operation.",
		"Objectives": "The goal is to design a device that can be attached onto a harvester or a product loader or as a stand-alone unit to effectively separate debris from the field run. A successful device should remove the debris effectively at a high loading pace without generating dust or air blowing. The device should be capable to separate fresh leaves or sticks in case of off-floor harvesting. ",

		"Background": "As good stewards, reducing visible dust during harvest is a priority for the almond industry. Current almond harvesting include tree shaking, nuts drying on orchard floor, sweeping to windrow, nut picking by harvesters, and nut transfer to trailer. Research have shown that more than 90% of PM10 are generated from the nut picking by harvester, and the visible dust may have a similar distribution. The harvesters blow air to separate dusts through a side chute during nut picking. Research have also indicated that decreasing separation airflow by 18% reduce airborne total suspended particles by 62%. ",
		"Problem": "The California almond industry commits to reduce dust during almond harvest by 50% by 2025. The industry is looking for options from low-dust harvest equipment to longer-term solutions like off-floor harvesting to achieve the dust reduction goal. One potential way to reduce dust from the nut picking is to contain or divert the dust blown off harvester.",
		"Objectives": "The goal is to design a device that can be attached onto dust exit spout or chute of an existing harvester to contain the dust or divert the dust onto orchard floor with minimal dust blowing disturbance. There are 4 vendors offering various versions of harvesters with different dimension of dust exit spout. A successful device that can be attached to one or any harvesters would reduce more than 50% dust from nut picking. ",

		"Background": "As the public’s first point of entry into the BART system, passenger stations are some of BART’s most prominent physical features. In addition to transit-facing spaces such as ticketing zones, concourses, and platforms, many stations also contain open, outdoor areas that fulfill some of the same functions as public parks—places where community members meet, spend time, and participate in neighborhood life. ",
		"Problem": "Though BART works to maintain these public spaces in line with community standards of cleanliness and safety, upkeep is a constant challenge. Exposure to the elements plus normal wear and tear combine with vandalism, littering, and other consequences of heavy use to make cleaning a near-constant job. Exposed surfaces, walls, and glass in plazas and other non-ticketed areas are particularly prone to the buildup of dirt, graffiti, scratches, and shattering over time. Garbage and grime are not only an eyesore, but a potential biohazard risk to patrons and staff.",
		"Objectives": "BART is looking for a solution to mitigate the effects of damage and contamination in and around its stations. The proposed interventions may involve sealants or other materials to resist the seeping in of substances over time, or may include a retrofit of existing surfaces. The plan must address, in a preventive way, the harm that occurs to the variety of surfaces present, including concrete, granite, glass and plexiglass. It must be environmentally sustainable, cost-effective and maintenance friendly, to augment BART’s standard regimen of power washing, graffiti removal, and waste cleanup. Those with an interest in environmental, mechanical, or materials engineering, and in the development of innovative approaches to aesthetic and hygienic standards in public spaces will find this to be an exciting project. The end result will improve the experience of all those who look to BART stations as centers of community life and will help enhance public perceptions of the system and its facilities.",

		"Project Title": "Station lighting",
		"Background": "Since 1972, BART’s passenger stations have served as crucial transport hubs for the Bay Area. They provide riders with safe and accessible points at which to begin and end journeys, or to connect to longer trips throughout the region and beyond. But more than mere stopovers between first and last mile, many stations are iconic features of the local landscape, receiving praise for their design and their harmony with surrounding communities. Toward BARTs goal of maintaining friendly and inspiring public spaces, the importance of lighting cannot be overstated. ",
		"Problem": "Unfortunately, there are a number of obstacles which stand in the way of optimized station lighting, including the inability to detect dead or dim bulbs remotely and the lack of efficient, accurate measurement of illumination levels in specific areas. Furthermore, there are lighted zones that are simply hard to reach, particularly high above staircases and escalator routes. Delayed maintenance in these areas can result in both a suboptimal aesthetic experience and potential safety issues for riders and system staff.",
		"Objectives": "This project will require the design of an illumination monitoring system that minimizes inspection time and maintenance interaction, while maintaining surveillance of predetermined illumination levels based on industry standards (e.g., those of the Illumination Engineering Society of North America [IES]). The system shall be inconspicuous and physically unobtrusive, yet capable of monitoring all hard-to-reach places. Most importantly, it must be safe to use on station platforms—it cannot include components that may fall onto the tracks, block destination signs or make floors slippery. The successful solution may draw from the knowledge base of electrical, mechanical, materials, systems, and other engineering disciplines and will present an innovative, maintenance-friendly approach to the issues described above. This project is an opportunity for those studying mechanical, environmental, or computer engineering to greatly enhance the quality and aesthetic value of shared spaces connecting people not only to their transit destinations, but to one another.",

		"Project Title": "Oxygen generation",
		"Background": "The NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a Federally Funded Research and Development Center, located in the Arroyo Seco Mountains in Pasadena, CA. Originating as a laboratory of the California Institute of Technology, JPL has been in the aerospace industry since the 1920s. Dedicated to the unmanned exploration of the solar system, JPL has built interplanetary probes, orbiters, and landers to explore our universe and expand our knowledge.",
		"Problem": "In situ resource utilization (ISRU) has become a critical part of space exploration. JPL’s upcoming mission to mars, the Mars 2020 rover will include an instrument to demonstrate the production of oxygen. MOXIE (Mars oxygen in situ experiment) uses a solid oxide electrolyzer to split carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and oxygen. While this technology was chosen for the mission, there are other ways to generate oxygen form carbon dioxide. The ability to scale oxygen generation for human missions (to make propellant and breathable oxygen) is especially important, and will require a thorough trade study. Assessing all technologies and finding the one option that fits all mission parameters will be critical for the success of human exploration of Mars.",
		"Objectives": "JPL is looking for alternative methods to generate oxygen using the Martian atmosphere. These methods will be compared to the existing technology based on not only mission-critical parameters such as power and mass, but other aspects as well. One alternative already identified is to use solar thermochemical splitting of carbon dioxide, using a metal oxide catalyst bed. The objective is to show that thermochemical splitting is not only a viable candidate, but also a more suitable candidate than the solid oxide electrolyzer. This study will involve mass and energy balance, but also the complexity of the design and the ability to scale up to larger designs.",

		"Problem": "Harvesting operations for the processed tomato industry is considered a “destructive” process, by the way the plant is yanked from the field (root and all). The harvesting machine has dedicated sorting equipment to remove “material other than tomatoes” from the product stream. Sometimes; plant debris (sized like a tomato) will make the trip through the product stream & effect the product quality. Sorting systems at the processing plants are designed to remove this excess debris, with mechanical limitations to sort out more than 20% of MOT on a conveyor belt. Previous UC Merced Capstone Engineering project Team has improved the shape & effectiveness of the hooks. In fact, the system removes so many vines, we are having a hard time removing them from the de-viner fingers/arms, and as a result will “clog” the system.",
		"Objectives": "Come up with 3 effective clean-in-place system recommendations for the De-viners. Perform Field Testing on all 3 designs, & record test results. Provide report including statistical analysis of cost vs. benefit of each system. Provide final recommendation for CIP system, & deliver formal quotes for installation.

		"Problem": "We would like to develop a swaddle for premature infants that can provide the same UV light provided by a bili light, pictured to the right. A bili light is used to treat neonatal jaundice, a liver condition caused by a high concentration of bilirubin in the blood. The current treatment method disrupts the infant’s sleep patterns, which slows the infant’s healing, increasing his or her time in the NICU. This makes him or her more susceptible to HAIs. The new swaddle must be autoclavable or be able to be sterilized to the same effect, not just machine washable. It also must utilize flexible fiber optics embedded into the swaddle. The fabric of the swaddle must also be hypoallergenic and flexible.",
		"Objectives": "A success in the project would be the creation of a bili swaddle that is more comfortable than the current designs on the market. Also, the swaddle must be autoclavable, or be able to be sterilized to the same effect. We can measure the success by measuring the correct light intensity and if the swaddle can survive being autoclaved.",

Most of the water the farm uses is delivered via canals that are often lined with weeds. When the weeds go to seed, the seed ends up in the water and ultimately into production fields. Weeds cost growers around the world Billions of dollars each year and mechanisms to control weeds have been developed since man first started growing seed. While we have made significant advancements in our ability to control weeds, the ability to prevent weed seed banks from establishing in the first place is still a pressing issue growers face around the world.

At this depth, most seed will not germ. However, we also pre-irrigate most of our crops using sprinklers and or with flood/furrow irrigation. We believe that these delivery mechanisms are also delivering seed to the fields that was collected in the canals. ",
		"Objectives": "Bowles is looking for a mechanism that would remove seed in water for sprinkler and flood/furrow irrigation after the water has been delivered from the Canal. Bowles will provide examples of tours of existing delivery systems, any needed materials and building space as needed for the project. The project will be advised by Danny Royer, the VP of Technology from Bowles Farming Company.",

		"Problem": "We want to automate positioning and measurement of 30x60 aluminum screwcaps for continuous inline measurement, feeding data to our SPC system. Our 30x60 cap lines are capable of processing over 500 parts per minute, of which only a handful rare measured to ensure proper tolerance. Furthermore, there is a lag time between sampling and testing. This limits our abilities to catch issues as they happen, and results in waste, quality issues, and lost time. There is low confidence in the data due to the small sample size, further increasing waste when investigating customer issues. To solve this issue, we’d like to incorporate a high-speed measurement system, capable of rapidly measuring critical dimensions and features based on image-measurement technology and laser profilometry.",

		"Problem": "G3 provides packaging materials designed to protect its beverage customers’ products. The wine industry is beginning to understand the impact of their packages’ oxygen transmission rates (OTR) on the shelf-life and wine development. G3 has developed technologies that allow customers to control the OTR through screwcap liners along with the retention of carbon dioxide in their bottled products. The newest liner technology is made using an injection molding process. To control OTR, G3 has worked with partners who have proprietary and relatively expensive polymer systems. G3 would benefit from being able to use an “inert” additive in a low-cost polyolefin, such as low-density polyethylene, to control OTR’s and carbon dioxide retention. G3 is looking for a low cost, food-grade additive for one of their current injection molded liner polyolefin materials allowing the control of oxygen transmission rates and the minimization of carbon dioxide loss from screwcap sealed glass bottles.",
		"Objectives": "Recommend and test low cost, food-grade additives that increase the oxygen and carbon dioxide gas barrier properties of G3’s patent pending injection molded screwcap liners. The additive must be compatible with the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) materials G3 uses to produce the current commercial liners. The materials must also have no odor after incorporation into the LDPE and injection molding into the liner profile. By the end of the semester, G3 expects prototypes of liners containing the additives along with oxygen transmission rate results quantifying the impact of the additives on the oxygen barrier properties. Additionally, analytics models quantifying the impact of the additive factors that are driving the change in OTR are expected. Finally, an analysis of the additive’s financial impact on the liner’s cost is required.",

		"Problem": "Automated transplanting of nursery plants is widely used in the vegetable industry. However, there are two main difficulties to overcome when applying this technology to strawberries: 1) strawberry bare roots are planted through a plastic cover that lays on top of the soil, and 2) the bare root plants vary in size and shape and are difficult to manipulate uniformly. As a result, this process is performed by hand. This incurs many disadvantages such as non-uniformed spacing, roots drying out, and difficulties in managing labor logistics.",

		"Project Title": "Wastewater solids management",
		"Background": "The Wine Group is the country’s 2nd largest winery by volume, 3rd largest worldwide. TWG grows, processes, bottles and ships in excess of 50 million of cases a year. There are 10 wineries in California as far north as Sonoma and as far south as McFarland as well as wineries in Westfield New York and Loxton Australia. Since its establishment in 1981, TWG has emphasized establishing partnerships with surrounding local industry and university systems in order to foster positive growth within both the company and the community. This specific project focuses on the management and treatment of wastewater solids at multiple TWG facilities in the San Joaquin Valley. ",
		"Problem": "The wine-making process tends to be extensive, with a multitude of steps and filtration methods needed before the final product is produced. Towards the end of the process the wine goes through a filter to assist in removing deformable and gelatinous solids. One of the ways these solids have typically been removed is though the help of Diatomaceous earth, also known as DE or diatomite. This material is the naturally occurring fossilized remains of microscopic single-celled aquatic algae called diatoms. Due to its small pore structure and wide variety of irregular shapes it makes an ideal filtration medium, however, because it is composed of almost entirely abrasive silica it has been revealed to be potentially dangerous to human life when inhaled. In the past TWG has used DE as a filtration medium, but upon realizing its potential risks to its workers has made the transition to a less dangerous filtration medium called Perlite. While Perlite has been proven to be the more health-conscious filtration method, it has complicated the way manufacturers like TWG have to filter their wastewater streams. The Wine Group utilizes a wide range of simplistic, mechanical systems for the filtration of wastewater steams created at their facilities. These filtration devices range from rotary and parabolic screens, to weir systems, to settling and cycling tanks. The wastewater streams produced at TWG facilities often have the tendency to hold solid particulate matter ranging in size and density due to the use of both DE and Perlite filtration mediums. Due to DE’s heavier density it typically sinks to the tank bottom, whereas Perlite has the propensity to float in the water column. The team’s foremost purpose in this project will be to establish an efficient method or methods of filtration for the wide range of solids found in TWG’s wastewater streams. Not only will would this be beneficial to conserving energy and efficiency for TWG, but the reduction of solids in the wastewater stream will also help control the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) loading rates for TWG’s land application areas (LAA) and surrounding vineyards. ",
		"Objectives": "The success criteria of this project would be the identification of unknown efficiencies from current procedures, optimization of facility process flow leading to more efficient solid separation methods, and the implementation of more effective separation systems. ",

Consumers, especially children do not tolerate face masks well as it is difficult to retain a face mask and has to be partially removed when eating or drinking. This increases vulnerability to infections or pollution. We hope to design a nose filter which is comfortable and  more user friendly especially to children. ** Requirement to assign intellectual property to Valley Chidren’s to participate in this project.",
		"Objectives": "The final design can be tested at VCH designated places and would need to meet Standards of Material management regarding: hypoallergenic qualities, airway resistance, filter capability, application, retention feasibility and cosmetic desirability. Metrics for some of these are available. ",

		"Project Title": "Track obstruction",
		"Background": "Since the early 1970s, BART has provided passengers with fast, reliable, and safe transportation throughout both the Bay Areas urban core and lower-density outlying areas. The system encompasses 121 miles of track, of which 32 miles are aerial, 61 miles are at grade and about 28 miles underground. With such an extensive wayside network, BART faces the constant challenge of maintaining track clearance and functionality, particularly along uncovered outdoor routes.",
		"Problem": "Track obstructions such as tree branches and garbage pose fire hazards and can cause the train control system to register the presence of a nonexistent train on the trackway, known as a false occupancy. Avoidance of operational delays is critical. Other obstructions include stray animals—and even the occasional human—trespassing wayside. Although relatively rare, these occurrences delay service, causing late arrivals and missed transit connections for passengers.",
		"Objectives": "The goal of this project is to improve BARTs ability to manage track obstructions via an apparatus or procedure that reduces the time taken to detect and address these issues. The focus will be on aerial and at-grade track. As part of the successful completion of this effort, the project team will deliver both a functional prototype and a report describing the technology involved. The report must provide comprehensive specifications including the following: accuracy—how accurate and precise the detection mechanism is; Speed – both how fast the mechanism deploys and the speed at which inspection is carried out; obstruction type—what kinds of objects would be identified; range; and financial impact to BART operations. This project provides a unique opportunity to assist BART in its ongoing efforts to provide the safest and most efficient transit services possible for its riders. Computer science and mechanical engineering students are encouraged to join this exciting project.",

		"Project Title": "Underground Geolocation Solution",
		"Background": "The BART system comprises over 121 miles of track across six lines, linking 48 passenger stations throughout the San Francisco Bay Area. BART currently employs two different processes to locate points within the system, based on distances from fixed locations. These methods allow BART staff to address routine maintenance needs as well as emergency issues like track obstructions in a timely and efficient manner. ",
		"Problem": "However, the system lacks an effective means of immediate geolocation in subterranean areas. Global Positioning System technology (GPS) has been a game-changer in countless fields over the past few decades. But due to the limitations of existing technology, underground GPS functionality remains sporadic and imprecise. With 15 below-ground stations and approximately 28 miles of subway track, BART has an extensive subterranean footprint. Because BART staff are at a considerable disadvantage when exact geolocation is required to address underground system issues, the results are maintenance inefficiencies and ultimately, service delays.",
		"Objectives": "The goal of this project is to optimize BART’s positioning and navigation systems in order to better pinpoint underground locations. The proposed solution will be an easy-to-use, intuitive app with mobile platform support. It will most likely adapt existing tools like Bluetooth, WiFi hotspots, and currently available GPS functionality, potentially in tandem with next-generation technology like Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radio to provide BART with unmatched geolocation performance. The benefits of precise underground positioning to system efficiency and maintenance are clear; other possible applications include the ability to program system equipment and vehicles to run along defined coordinate paths, and faster, pinpointed response to emergencies, security issues, and routine passenger needs. These enhancements will improve rider safety and satisfaction throughout the system, all while saving time and cutting operating costs. This project provides a unique opportunity to help build a better BART, for those interested in app development, computer science and systems engineering, and the continued optimization of public transport functionality for all members of the Bay Area community.",

		"Project Title": "Safe Pigeon Abate Solution",
		"Background": "BART’s 48 passenger stations are critical points of departure, arrival, and transfer for millions of transit riders across the Bay Area each year. They also function as community hubs for locals and visitors alike, anchoring civic, retail, and residential zones and serving as neighborhood landmarks in their own right. ",
		"Problem": "Unfortunately, pigeons—like their human counterparts—find the stations (and BART’s numerous electrical substations and maintenance facilities) to be ideal community meeting places. The birds not only create an unpleasant atmosphere for patrons, they present a potential biohazard for BART staff, particularly in confined work spaces. They also inflict lasting damage on equipment. Although BART has tried several solutions over the years, none so far has struck the right balance between aesthetic appeal and successful resolution of the problem.",
		"Objectives": "The goal of this project is to innovate an effective, environmentally friendly, humane, and visually pleasing pigeon abatement solution for BART stations and facilities. Past efforts have utilized wire, netting, and other physical deterrents to unsatisfactory effect. The successful approach to this challenge may involve physical, material, chemical, or even acoustic interventions, and will prioritize ease of use and dependability. At the same time, care must be taken to ensure that the birds are not harmed. Specific problem areas include parking lot lighting, signage, concrete walls, platforms, and other exposed surfaces. One of BART’s foremost goals is to provide clean, comfortable, functional spaces for riders and staff, whether they are spending extended periods of time in the system or just passing through. Although by and large this goal is realized, pigeon abatement is an area where work remains to be done. This project  offers an opportunity to shape the next generation of sustainable and attractive solutions to an issue of importance to the health, safety, and quality of life of all BART stakeholders. Those majoring in materials or environmental science, mechanical or biological engineering, and related disciplines are encouraged to lend their knowledge and skills to this innovative opportunity.",

This will allow trainees to practice on a real model of the individual patient prior to working with the attending surgeon. They would also have the opportunity to explore in real life the pros and cons of different surgical approaches to an individual patient. The constraints are that this must be done from any MRI of the spine in standard DICOM format. Free tools are available that will help (NIH Image. Slicer and the surgical planning website from harvard https://proxy.qualtrics.com/proxy/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spl.harvard.edu%2Fpages%2FOverview&token=fdHxJcyOq2gTQzC73TbKU3SQ1XYm0%2FX68AGCvnTtHC4%3D https://proxy.qualtrics.com/proxy/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fncigt.org%2Fneurosurgery-core&token=K5W5BB5hXSKN8RBqSLL9yFJNKOsJN9wgs%2FNjBef9x9U%3D). The challenge is to make the output model have different textures or strengths mimicking bone (hard) and connective tissue (soft) and maybe even different colors for bone, nerves and disc material. Once this is accomplished then a set of tools similar to actual surgical tools should be available to work with the model created. ",
		"Objectives": "Step 1-Simple access from Clinical MRI of the spine to 3D object. Step 2-The 3D spine model must be able to be placed on a support so that simulated surgery can be perfored. Step 3-The surgeon doing a simulated surgery on the simulated spine object should be able to recognize different structures during the procedure (nerve, disc, bone, connective tissue) by either color or texture or stiffness.",

We are a group of Visual Programming enthusiasts that meet once a month in San Francisco. The objective of the groups is to foster the exchange of innovative workflow, explore visual programming ideas, share case studies of Computational Design based examples applied to real world problems, and bring together a pool of local Computational Design users.  HOK and SFCDUG are located in San Francisco. The project will be focused on facilitating the visualization of architectural details in order to reduce the cognitive load and solve hard engineering modeling problems.",
		"Problem": "The need is to improve the current workflow and facilitate the design practice.   The clients will be benefited in showing this example their clients as well.  There are negotiable constraints imposed:  Budget: 100.000",
		"Objectives": "For the project will be required a material engineering, computer science, and mechanical engineer.  The project is related to the development of mockup of architectural details order to decrease the costs but provide a high quality and high-performance product.  Augmented Reality can be used to help the architects in the design and especially in the visualization of the final aspect of the facade.  Furthermore, during the time that can help in visualizing the performance of the facade and create awareness about its conditions in order to facilitate the facility management.   The client expects to address at least 3 of the five points:  1. Build the model 3d (Rhinoceros).  2. Transfer the data to Unity. 3. Materials.  4. Information.  5. Instruction Motion.   The client will measure the performance of the team’s product based on goals and tasks decided at the begging with the team.",

		"Project Title": "Screwcap optimization",
		"Background": "G3 Enterprises is an industry leader in beverage packaging and logistics located in Modesto, CA. We provide integrated packaging solutions from grape to glass to a wide variety of wine and spirits customers. Our activities range from the manufacture of packaging materials such as screwcaps, corks, and labels to the transportation of grapes, juice, and wine to consulting with packaging lines to help solve problems or increase efficiencies. G3 serves a broad range of customers in the Beverage and Agriculture industries, including wines & spirits, beers, cider & coffee, and specialty beverages & food. We are committed to adopting environmentally sound practices and products. Our processes strive to minimize waste, maximize the use of materials and conserve resources. Our belief is that a healthy environment is critical to a successful business. We operate with the highest ethical standards to ensure that we achieve excellence, while nurturing and protecting our land.",
		"Problem": "Our 30x60 ROPE (roll on, pilfer-evident) screwcaps are formed through 3 drawing stages, slitting/forming, and lining operation. They are then shipped to the customer who applies the caps to their bottles. The end consumer then twists off the cap, breaking the pilfer-evident band and ultimately accessing the bottled product. The team will be asked to create a model for the 30x60 cap for stresses during the application and removal of the cap on the bottle, and propose optimizations in design, materials, and/or application parameters.The problem we are facing is that we do not have a complete understanding of the stresses in our existing product, which limits our options when we need to make tooling adjustments, or when a customer has an issue. Solving this problem will allow us to be more flexible and confident when recommending changes to our process, possibly resulting in millions of dollars of savings. Non-negotiable: Existing application specifications (at the bottling line)",
		"Objectives": "Have an FEA Analysis done for the sheet metal through finished cap, applied cap, and cap on removal. Gather materials and design a new set of specification ranges for material alloy and temper based on FEA Analysis and modifications to surface features while retaining critical dimensions. ",

		"Project Title": "Ceres Main Reuglating Reservoir",
		"Background": "The Turlock Irrigation District has a complex system of canals used to convey water via gravity flow from our reservoirs in the foothills. Because the water is gravity fed, manually operated, and highly complex, fluctuations in flow rate and water level develop as water moves down the system. These fluctuations cause what is referred to as “operational spills” to the various natural waterways surrounding the District. Given the increasing importance of conserving water, the District is committed to reducing these spills. One proven method of reducing these fluctuations has been to locate a regulating reservoir at a point farther down the system to act as a “flow reset” point. The reservoir draws water out of the canal system when flows are higher than they are supposed to be and discharges water into the canal when flows are lower. In this way, it balances the flow in the canal and removes water that would ultimately spill, using it to improve customer service by preventing shortages.",

		"Objectives": "Given a pre-selected location on the District’s Ceres Main canal, design a regulating reservoir that will divert water from the canal and use it to stabilize flows. Determine the critical specifications of the reservoir such as storage capacity, cost of construction, time to construct, spill water saved, and intake and discharge capacity.

		"Project Title": "Rural Fiber",
		"Background": "Turlock Irrigation District provides irrigation water to over 150,000 acers of farmland and power to nearly 100,000 customers. With a service area of about 660 square miles, reliable communication between equipment and operating personnel is critical.To effectively cover such a large service area, there is nearly 100 miles of fiber optic cable connecting power generation facilities, switch yards, substations, and other critical assets. Unfortunately, nearly 70% of that fiber is strung over rural areas including farms, canals, rivers, and marsh. This leaves the fiber especially vulnerable to damage, both malicious and inadvertent. Fiber optic cable is relatively resilient, but it does have limitations. Gunshots are a major source of fiber damage in the district and occur regularly in rural areas. The damage they cause usually result in complete communication loss. Firearm damage distinguishes itself from other forms of fiber damages both by the frequency of occurrences and difficulty troubleshooting. Generally, fiber damaged in this way is nearly impossible to identify from the ground and only a rough location can be determined with optical metering equipment.Once Identified, the damaged portion of the cable can only be repaired by replacing large spans of fiber optic cable and installing expensive splice boxes that add attenuation to the system, reduce its life span, and increase stress on poles.",

		"Project Title": "Escalator Step Chain Stretch",
		"Background": "Escalators provide quick and easy vertical transportation to and from the BART system. Currently every BART Station in the system has escalators. Due to the high usage, approximately 20 hours per day, harsh environment, physical abuse and complex nature of these machines they require numerous hours of maintenance and cleaning to run properly. Since escalator down time is highly discouraged, maintenance access is very limited.",
		"Problem": "One of the persistent problems with downtown San Francisco Street level escalators is the elongation of the step chain over time, “stretch”. The elongation can be created by many causes such as road grit, lack of lubrication, moisture and corrosion, tight turning radius and uneven loading. Each escalator has two chains driven by large “bull gears”, the steps are locked into these chains. As the chains wear the steps drift apart producing a gap. Once the gap is non- code compliant the escalator will be out of service for approximately a week while the old chains are replaced with the new chains. Therefore, some type of automatic escalator step chain measuring device would be useful.",
		"Objectives": "Design an automatic measurement system that will measure the escalator step chain increase in length and provide input into local Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system. Design and submit, for approval all schematic diagrams. Provide all drawings and schematics in AutoCAD readable format (.dwg). Develop commissioning procedures. Coordinate with BART staff to install proto-type and commission. This project will allow BART to procure and schedule replacement of the step chain.",

		"Project Title": "Computer Room HVAC",
		"Background": "The BART computer room was constructed back in the late 1960’s to early 1970’s with minor modifications to the HVAC components specifically the ductwork, “air distribution”. Currently the computer room has a raised floor. The plenum beneath the floor is specifically used for HVAC supply. The supply air is directed, via porous floor tiles, to specific locations within the room, as needed.",
		"Problem": "Over the years the biggest changes to the computer room have been the advancement in technology. This advancement, such as communication, has caused for the introduction of numerous electronic boxes in racks all of which dissipate heat into the room. The original design did not take into consideration these advancements. Therefore, the current situation is that the air flow is inefficient causing the employees and equipment to work in a warm environment.Since the quantity of electronics will not be reduced the modification to the HVAC airflow must be addressed. The HVAC tonnage is sufficient and not an issue.",
		"Objectives": "The HVAC air flow in the current computer room is inefficient resulting in employees working in an uncomfortable environment. Without changing the chillers and cooling tower, design and develop a solution or solutions for maintaining the computer room between 68 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer months. Review the room characteristics and develop a methodology to provide better air flow across the computer equipment. Provide and submit for approval, all new equipment, calculations, computer simulations, curtains, racks, cable routing, ducting and schematic diagrams.

		"Project Title": "Sprinkler Flex Coupler Phase 2",
		"Background": "The combination of increases in minimum wage and new overtime rules have significant bottom line implications to businesses in California. This is especially true for irrigation activities on farms, which have traditionally had little to no overtime rules. Many irrigation activities, like moving sprinklers, are also the most strenuous and hardest on the body for workers. In recent years Bowles Farming Company has diversified its cropping rotation and is now growing more specialty crops that require sprinklers for best irrigation practices. Therefore, in 2017 Bowles began researching opportunities to improve efficiencies and the ergonomics of sprinkler activities on the farm. In 2017 a UCM Capstone Team found that simply coupling the pipes together with a flexible coupler could significantly increase the efficiency of moving sprinklers and reduce the physical impact of the activities on workers. They developed and produced a prototype. Upon completion of the Capstone Project, Bowles continued pursuing the idea and developed a second prototype",

		"Project Title": "Feed the Monarchs",
		"Background": "In 2017 Environmental Defense Fund launched a campaign to save the Monarch Butterfly and Bowles Farming Company wants to help. Milkweed is essential to the survival of Monarchs and unfortunately much of the milkweed habitat across the nation has been consumed by urban expansion and agriculture activities. In order for the restoration of habitat to occur, Milkweed will need to make very strong come back. This will require lots of seed, produced at levels not seen in milkweed seed production before. Bowles has committed acreage to growing Milkweed for Seed production and is looking for a UCM Capstone Team to help solve two specific problems in the seed production process.",
		"Problem": "During the Spring 2018 a Capstone team took on this project an built an initial prototype. During the course of their project, they were limited on supply of actual Milkweed to process. This Fall Bowles will have a Milkweed Crop to harvest and will be testing the initial prototype provided by the Spring 2018 Capstone team.",
		"Objectives": "Bowles is looking for a team to industrialize the prototype and increase the productivity and scalability of the prototype. Bowles will provide the original prototype, space for construction, access to fabricators and any additional materials or supplies needed to improve the project. Team members will also have access to Bowles Farming Companies Environmental Program Director as an advisor for this project. ",

		"Short Summary (final text)": "Milkweed Seed comes in pods full of fibers that are designed to attach to wildlife or blow in the wind to transport the seed. In order to generate seed at a commercial scale to meet projected restoration demands, Bowles needs to figure out how to best Harvest the Seed and separate or “clean” the Seed from the fiber that comes with it. This project could focus on solving this problem in two separate processes and only focus on one, or combine the harvest and seed cleaning into one process. Bowles will provide existing practices and acquire examples for the Team to use in development and to test any prototypes with.",

		"Project Title": "Polished Water Cleaning",
		"Background": "At Hilmar Cheese Company & Hilmar Ingredients, we use reverse osmosis to recover water from milk used in the cheese‐making process. We refer to this water as “Polished Water.” The majority of the polished water is utilized for cleaning purposes throughout the site, and a portion of it is used in the making of our ingredients products such as Lactose and Whey Protein. After the polished water is generated, it is sent to holding silos where sodium hypochlorite is added to suppress the development of bacterial growth in water.",
		"Problem": "After the polished water is generated, it is sent to holding silos where sodium hypochlorite is added to suppress the development of bacterial growth in water. Sodium hypochlorite, however, can degrade over time to form chlorate ions. Chlorates are undesirable and we strive to keep chlorate levels within specification. Sodium hypochlorite is also a corrosive agent that reacts with stainless steel, slowly corroding equipment and pipelines. The above reasons have prompted HCC to research and study design feasibility of other available disinfectant technologies.",

		"Project Title": "Sambuca Navigation Algorithm",
		"Background": "The goal of the Sambuca Demo Project is to build and demonstrate an autonomous application for compact track loader (skidsteer) machines. The base configuration for these small machines includes a loader bucket, and typical tasks would include disposition of material stockpiles and rudimentary excavation. The typical users of these machines are skilled but not sophisticated and detailed computer based site plans are generally not available so our design philosophy is to utilize high level task specification (similar to instructing a human worker) and task centered localization (mapping the relationship between the implement and target material).",
		"Problem": "The demo application selected is to Move a Stockpile (i.e. take buckets of dirt from an existing pile and dump at another location).  We have decomposed that top level task into a number of sub tasks and associated competencies which can be developed independently, implemented as ROS nodes and services, and shared or reused for other tasks. Reflecting the economics of the target market our sensor set is vision based augmented by rudimentary IMU and low precision GPS. We have implemented a ROS framework and uniform interfaces to 2 platforms: a small CTL like model for ease of development indoors (HouseCat), and a small unmanned CTL for field testing (M-48)",
		"Objectives": "The proposed Capstone project is to design and implement the algorithm set required for navigation between the localized subtasks of the top level demo application.  Successful execution will require several component competencies including: recognition and recollection of site features specified by the user (the existing source pile and markers delineating the dump location), collection and classification of GPS waypoints during traversals, and execution of traversals between sub task locations. Deliverables include working code implemented to the Sambuca ROS framework and a live demonstration on the M-48 platform in Livermore. The student project team will be provided with one HouseCat system for use in developing and testing algorithms, access to the M-48 in Livermore, and access to and support from the Livermore Engineering staff as required.

By laminating a number of smaller pieces of lumber, a single large, strong, structural member is manufactured from smaller pieces. These structural members are used as vertical columns or horizontal beams, as well as curved, arched shapes. Glulam is readily produced in curved shapes and it is available in a range of species and appearance characteristics to meet varied end-use requirements. Connections are usually made with bolts or plain steel dowels and steel plates. Glulam optimizes the structural values of a renewable resource – wood. Because of their composition, large glulam members can be manufactured from a variety of smaller trees harvested from second- and third-growth forests and plantations. Glulam provides the strength and versatility of large wood members without relying on the old growth-dependent solid-sawn timbers. As with other engineered wood products, it reduces the overall amount of wood used when compared to solid sawn timbers by diminishing the negative impact of knots and other small defects in each component board. Glulam has much lower embodied energy than reinforced concrete and steel, although it entails more embodied energy than solid timber. However, the laminating process allows timber to be used for much longer spans, heavier loads, and complex shapes. Glulam is two-thirds the weight of steel and one sixth the weight of concrete – the embodied energy to produce it is six times less than the same suitable strength of steel. Glulam can be manufactured to a variety of straight and curved configurations so it offers architects artistic freedom without sacrificing structural requirements.",

		"Objectives": "This project would focus on taking a very low cost by-product (waste material) of biomass and making it into a laminated beam product. This project will also prove that it will be able to make it economic feasible to small manufacturers of laminated beam products. Currently only very large factories can afford the necessary capital investment needed to make the beams. We are looking for a new way to manufacture it that can be done in very little capital (under $100,000) so that small manufacturers can use the technology and be able to set up in rural communities near where 98% of biomass is currently located. This will keep the carbon footprint small for the product since only the completed beams will be shipped not the product it is made out of.",

		"Project Title": "Antifoam Addition System",
		"Background": "Each year, E. & J. Gallo’s Livingston Winery performs a process known as tank crushing in which red grapes are directly crushed into a fermentation tank. During fermentation, glucose present in grape juice is converted to ethanol and carbon dioxide (CO2) via yeast inoculation. Mechanical agitation of this mixture releases entrained CO2 and increases the risk for a fermenter foamover. A foamover occurs when foam, generated by the combination of CO2 and juice/wine, accumulates fast enough to spill out over the top of the fermentation tank. To date, foamovers have been regarded as a normal occurrence at the Livingston Winery. However, foamovers result in juice/wine on the ground which contributes to yield loss and sanitation issues. Currently, the only way to stop a foamover is to manually add antifoam, a liquid emulsifier, over the tops of the fermentation tanks. E. & J. Gallo Winery would like to find a more efficient way to add antifoam to fermentation tanks including a more reliable, proactive addition system to reduce the number of foamovers.",

		"Project Title": "MOG Prevention System",
		"Background": "At E. &. J Gallo’s Livingston Winery, all grapes crushed on site are received into a crush pit which conveys the grapes to a set of de-stemmers that separate grape stems from grape must (juice, skins, etc.). If any de-stemmers break down, it results in equipment downtime which can halt production for several hours and cause a significant work backlog. One of the most common and impactful causes of de-stemmer breakdowns has been the introduction of MOG (Materials Other than Grapes) into the de-stemmers. This MOG can come in the form of grape vines, canes, or trellis parts. Currently, MOG is manually picked out of the crush pits using long-handled tools and only visible MOG is able to be removed. E. & J. Gallo Winery would like to find a more efficient way to prevent MOG from reaching the de-stemmers to minimize de-stemmer breakdowns.",

Urodynamic studies are often used to monitor the patients during therapy or to decide when certain procedures should be performed. It would be useful for patients to regularly monitor simple parameters regarding the ability to void and provide that information regularly to their provider to use in decision making process. One of these, the maximal urine flow rate is a function of the resistance to flow in the urethra and the bladder pressure.",

		"Problem": "Gait problems occur in many patients and are a major clinical problem. They may arise in patients with neuropathy who cannot feel or use position information from the feet. They also arise in patients with motor control problems. The problem with the standard walker is that it prevents the patient from falling forward but not from falling backward because all of the support is in front of the patient. A walker with front and back supports is often too cumbersome to allow good mobility. Thus, designing an addition to the standard walker may improve patient quality of life.",
		"Objectives": "Design an improved walker that will prevent a patient from falling both forward AND backwards. This walker must be able to balance the weight of the patient regardless of their current position. When a backwards fall is detected, the walker must provide a restorative force to prevent falling. The device should include sensors to detect rotation of the patient and a control system to operate. There must be a possibility to adjust the settings of the walker to suit different patients.",

		"Project Title": "Acoustic-video intrument to diagnose middle ear disease",
		"Background": "Otitis media, or middle ear infection, is the second most common disease in infants and children in US. Otitis media with effusion (OME) is accompanied by accumulation of fluid in the middle ear cavity. The presence of this fluid impedes the movement of the tympanic membrane and leads to conductive hearing loss.  Acoustic reflectometry is a technique that can be used to detect the presence of middle ear effusion and conductive hearing loss with reasonable accuracy. Otoendoscopy can be used to visualize the tympanic membrane and study the signs of active infection/inflammation. The data from both, when matched against a diagnostic algorithm, may be used to accurately determine the middle ear condition.",
		"Problem": "The challenges in diagnosing the condition accurately include - determining the presence of fluid in the middle ear cavity, signs of active infection/inflammation of the tympanic membrane, and detection of any conductive hearing loss.",
		"Objectives": "Design an apparatus that can hold an otoendoscope (connected to a video capture system) and an acoustic reflectometer together in order to perform both tests simultaneously. The apparatus should be small enough to penetrate the ear canal in young children (average diameter 2.5 mm). Develop a protocol to match the data from the above tests against the diagnostic algorithm and determine the exact middle ear condition/disease.",

		"Background": "Super Insulated Green Building Technologies LLC (SIGBT) along with developing partner T3Energy of Australia, is currently working on development of new highly insulated and load bearing systems for residential construction. Current work uses wood shavings from construction offcut waste or sourced from bark beetle killed trees to manufacture a new composite material with above code insulation standards while also engineering a result which is sufficiently structurally strong to act as load bearing external walls for new energy efficient homes. 30 new homes have been successfully built in Australia with a prototype of this new building system. The Australian Managing Director will be available to provide support and guidance by skype conferencing for this Capstone project. California based staff will also provide backup for the project.",
		"Problem": null,
		"Objectives": "(1)Fabricate and thermally test samples of the new wood shavings composite using current components with varying proportions and densities to better understand how the thermal insulation performance can be optimized. (2) Investigate, fabricate and thermally test samples of the new wood shavings composite using additional components and or strategies which may further improve the thermal insulation performance of the composite.

		"Project Title": "Easy bulk dump elevator",
		"Background": "During the season, the Tomatoes are dumped from the Trucks into a secondary small water flume. The tomatoes are then elevated to another water flume using a belt elevator. The small water flume has water that is recycled and gets saturated with sand. There is no proper way of a steady stream sand separation from the water circuit and replenishment of fresh water. Currently, this process is manual and subject to operator judgement. The Elevator system has several major leaks due to the abrasive nature of the system and a lot of incoming tomatoes are lost to the waste system. There is a clear opportunity to improve water recirculation, sand separation and plugging of the tomato leaks from the Bulk dump elevators.",

		"Objectives": "Design a system with controllable flow rates while utilizing potential pumping, gravity, sand separation methods such as hydro cyclones. Since water is the conveying medium, fluid mechanics of water recycling must be considered. The design should include the proper containment and minimize leakages of tomato to the waste stream.

		"Project Title": "Mechanical Solution for Neonatal CLABSI",
		"Background": "Central Line-Associated Blood Stream Infections (CLABSIs) is a primary laboratory confirmed bloodstream infection in a patient with a central line at the time of (or within 48-hours prior to) the onset of symptoms and the infection is not related to an infection from another site. Nearly 1 in 20 hospitalized patients acquire CLABSIs, which is considered one of the most deadly Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) yielding a 25% mortality rate. Central-lines are Central Venous Catheters (CVCs) that are inserted into large veins. CVCs support the survival of newborns and children in ICUs. They allow for multiple lines to be administered to the patient, which allow for medication delivery, measure blood pressure, and/or blood drawing without having to insert multiple needles. CVCs are inserted into the neck, chest, or groin. There are three types of CVCs: peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines, tunneled catheter and implanted port. In the NICU, PICCs and tunneled catheters are commonly used. Despite its fundamental roles, CVCs carry the risk of complications, demanding both constant surveillance and care by healthcare professionals to prevent CLABSI, morbidity and mortality. It has been shown that CLABSI rates are reduced in idle CVCs lines compared to ones in use. Though there are multiple potential complications that can occur during the administration of these devices, the focus of this project will be on complications caused by bloodstream infections: (1) extraluminal and (2) intraluminal (e.g. catheter track and hub contamination, respectively).",
		"Problem": null,
		"Objectives": "The primary objective of this project is to develop a device that facilitates a sterile process of administering the CVC that prevents CLABSI formation. This device will aim to eliminate the environment for bacteria formation through mechanical means and not chemicals or antibiotics. The secondary objective is to develop a streamlined braided shaft fabrication for catheter production.",

		"Project Title": "Accurate measurement of PH",
		"Background": "Commercial poultry operations use litter in their houses for bedding for their birds. The bedding is either sourced from wood chips or from rice hulls. During the normal flock development, the litter will become moisture due to fecal waste from the birds and spilled water from the drinkers. High moisture in the litter can be detrimental to the productivity of poultry due to an increase in health issues and the presence of insects. Flies and darkling beetles are drawn to the moisture and the litter becomes a breeding site for these insects. Flies can become a nuisance issue for neighbors in some cases. Currently, litter is treated by mechanical mixing using a rototiller to blend drier litter that is found in the house with the excessively moist litter. This mixing reduces the breeding sites available and breaks the reproductive cycle of these insects. Mechanical mixing is done at least every 3 days during the production cycle.Accurate measurement of pH, moisture and ammonia concentration in poultry litter is needed as part of a good poultry management program.",
		"Problem": null,
		"Objectives": "The purpose of this project would be to develop continuous measurement processes for these items on an existing robotic device that will be treating the litter on a continuous basis in a poultry facility. The measurement devices must be able to sample the litter, take measurements and then relay that information to a data collection/plc device. The goal would be to design a sampling process that will take multiple samples at different locations as the robot is mixing the litter. The results of the test will be used to determine what actions the robot will take to adjust the litter to maintain a condition within desired specifications.",

		"Project Title": "Vacuum Flow Optimization",
		"Background": "Scholle Packaging Company is one of the leading producers of flexible packaging that provides first-rate storage and distribution to highly expansive & lucrative businesses. An Automatic Bag Maker or ABM is the heart of this company; ABM 13 produces a large quantity of wine bags for local winery, which requires removal of the corners, referred to as delta cutouts. To prevent buildup of the scrap material, delta cutouts have to be vacuumed away from the machine by use of a 2 stage cyclone style vacuum and an inline vacuum manifold. The current design does not balance the flow and allow easy removal of the scrap material at the rate it is fed. The goal of the team would be to design a flow path for the scrap that would prevent the scrap from plugging in the vacuum manifold.",

		"Objectives": "Design, simulate and test a system to analyze the flow path for the ABM 13 Delta Cut-Out Vacuum System and optimize the flow rate needed to prevent congestion of the plastic material flowing through it. The system will then be duplicated onsite. This design will require a low cost solution, with simple installation. The group will be expected to provide flow analysis, installation plan, list of parts as well as a separate list of critical parts to keep onsite, schematic and prototype drawings in Solidworks, and test results.",

An Automatic Bag Maker or ABM is the heart of this company; all ABMs require the use of heated seal bars in order to produce seals on bags that provide the durability needed to keep the contents in the package. In order to provide a proper seal our seal bars are layered with protective heat barrier made from Teflon, in order to prevent the metal from sticking to the plastic as it creates the seal. Teflon is expensive and regularly has to be changed on these seal bars to provide a uniform seal on our bags. The goal of the team would be to research and test different materials to determine what would be the most cost effective solution to coat seal bars in to eliminate the use of Teflon tape as a protective barrier to hot seal bars.",

		"Background": "The Morning Star Company is the world’s largest producer of processed tomato products by a factor of three. The company is vertically integrated & services the harvesting & trucking industries to deliver a tomato from the field to the plant. Harvesting operations for the processed tomato industry is considered a “destructive” process, by the way the plant is yanked from the field (root and all). The harvesting machine has dedicated sorting equipment to remove “material other than tomatoes” from the product stream. Sometimes; plant debris (sized like a tomato) will make the trip through the product stream & effect the product quality. Sorting systems at the processing plants are designed to remove this excess debris, but have mechanical limitations to sort out more than 20% of MOT on a conveyor belt.",

		"Background": "As the largest winery in the world, E&J Gallo bottles over 70 million cases of wine each year at our Modesto Campus. Processing and packaging this amount of wine requires millions of gallons of water and Gallo’s Executive Leadership has challenged all facilities to reduce water consumption every year. Due to the continued reduction of water quality available to the facility, a reverse osmosis water system will be installed to produce water that is compatible with our piping and equipment infrastructure. Unfortunately, the reverse osmosis process produces a waste stream of water containing highly concentrated brine as nearly all salts and minerals are removed from the water.",
		"Problem": "This net result of installing this system will be a very large increase in the amount of water entering the facility and corresponding increase in the amount of wastewater being sent to the local utility for disposal. There are currently no viable process uses for this wastewater and land application is not an option.",
		"Objectives": "Research options for recovering as much of the reverse osmosis wastewater generated as possible for use in some or all winery processes. Generate high level layouts for recovery options. Develop cost estimates for options including capital requirements, cost of operation, and cost savings based on reduced costs for incoming water and wastewater disposal. Great project for those interested in machine and system design and environmental impacts.",

		"Project Title": "Syringe Pump Stickiness",
		"Background": "Syringe pumps are commonly used in patient care. A fixed rotating screw moves the piston of the syringe on a fixed base. The smaller the patient or volume of medication given, greater is the need for accuracy. For example a 1 kg infant has a total maintenance fluid input of approximately 80 ml. per 24 hrs. Thus medications are sometimes constituted in 1- 10 ml per dose and given over time. Almost always syringe pumps are utilized.",
		"Problem": "It is well recognized that these pumps do not deliver fluids uniformly over time. This is partly due to the ‘stickiness factor’. The plunger or piston in the delivery system of the pump encounters variable resistance when being pushed forward within the moist sleeve. Consequently medications like insulin or pressors get a mini bolus or lag behind causing physiological variations. The smaller the infant and the smaller volume of medication, greater is the variability. The variability of dynamic friction results in a pulsatile flow that further complicates downstream issues. The standard of care requires filters to be used to prevent bacteria and other foreign bodies from entering the patient. There is a possibility that the filters malfunction or break due to the pulsatile flow.",
		"Objectives": "Assess the severity of the issue by fluid volume, viscosity, size of syringe and rate of infusion. Recommend mitigating strategies. Elucidate the filter issues and suggest design modifications to prevent the same.",

		"Short Summary (final text)": "Syringe pumps are essential for intravenous medication delivery in neonatal units in hospitals. The syringe pumps must function at their highest capabilities but there is a stickiness problem that occurs within the syringes. This major problem facing modern syringes is a stickiness between the plunger and the barrel of the syringe caused by friction. This causes pressure fluctuations, inaccuracies in medication dosages, and potential for an open system. Therefore, we must improve upon the syringes to help them match the technology of the syringe pumps and allow dosage and flow consistency with the current hospital setup.",

Currently in the Stanislaus National Forest, 50-70% of the woody biomass on the forest floor is a fire hazard and must be removed in an optimal way to improve the health of the surrounding community. A viable product to produce on-site are fuel wood pellets, which require a feedstock of biomass at 10-20% moisture content. Biocraft is working to design a drying chamber to reduce the moisture content of the biomass through pressure reduction and heat transfer. The chamber will be an integral part of the design for a portable pellet press assembly.",

		"Background": "Sprinkler irrigation pipes are used quite often in California for specialty crops. Existing sprinkler system infrastructures require massive amounts of labor to install and move.",
		"Problem": "In order to execute in field activities such as cultivation, planting, spraying and side dressing, sprinkler pipe must be moved out of the way of equipment and then moved back into place. As labor costs are increasing in California, the opportunity for automated systems in the sprinkler irrigation is substantial.",
		"Objectives": "Design a system that eliminates or significantly reduces the required amount of labor to move sprinkler pipe in agriculture applications. Option 1: Design a system that can operate within existing sprinkler pipe infrastructure systems. Option 2: Design an entirely new system to deliver the same effects as sprinkler irrigation.",

		"Short Summary (final text)": "Bowles Farming Company is a sixth generation family farm that focuses on sustainability, conservation and preservation. They harvest many different crops in which they invest time and effort to ensure their highest quality. Bowles Farming Companys objective is to design a system that eliminates or significantly reduces the required amount of labor or time to move sprinkler pipe in agriculture applications. There are two options that can be used to reach the required objective: (1) Design a system that operates with the current sprinkler system or (2) Design an entirely new system that delivers the same effects as the existing sprinkler system. Bowles Farming Company recently invested a great amount of money in their current sprinkler system so a design that implemented the existing infrastructure would be ideal.  An effective design will implement the current sprinkler system, reduce labor costs, and improve efficiency by minimizing time spent relocating the sprinkler pipes.  ",

		"Project Title": "Design a Clamp System for Blown Fiber Filling",
		"Background": "La-Z-Boy West is responsible for delivering an average of 1,200 units daily, varying from over 600 styles! These styles vary vastly from the material that is used to how they are made. For a certain percentage of these units the back portion is made of blown fiber bags, instead of our conventional polyurethane foam.",
		"Problem": "The blown fiber is received in large bales which are then broken down via large rollers to a specific quality specification and then transported through a pressurized ducting to a final piping/nozzle via an air pump at a mass rate of 1,200 lbs. per hour. A gate in the final piping is lifted via an 110V foot pedal operated by the employee who provides power to a pneumatic linear actuator which lifts the gate and allows the fiber to continue through. The final piping has an OD of 4-1/8” (thickness of ~1/16”, steel alloy wrapped in a non-piezoelectric tape to prevent static charge from shocking employees) which the employees must secure a bag around. The issue at hand is that the pipe is in such a position that grasping the bag’s opening profile over the pipe when applying air pressure has affected employee ergonomics and has led to employee injuries averaging $40,929.93 per year since 2010.",
		"Objectives": "The task at hand is to develop a “clamp” system which securely fastens the bag around the nozzle via actuating motion arms, or a radial encompassing which can be initiated using the same foot-pedal (the powering/controls will not be within this project scope) but must have the same leads to a double actuating foot pedal which are compatible with our current actuator. Note, that not all the bags have a circular pattern for their openings so a conventional radial clamp will not function for this application. Schematics, production metrics, desired variables of the system, layout and anthropometric data will be provided during the first team meeting.",

		"Short Summary (final text)": "La-Z-Boy is a prominent furniture manufacturer specializing in making customize-able furniture with a focus on making a house a home since 1928. A customize-able option is the use of blown-fiber pillows as backs & arm support. However, this cloud-like experience has led to numerous injuries within the manufacturing plant due to a manual process with a large outlet pipe resulting in employee having strains, sprains, and even surgery as corrective actions due the wide grip needed. The goal of this project is to create an autonomous clamp system for various bags to mitigate any such event from further occurring again.",

		"Project Title": "Multi-kill Rodent Trap",
		"Background": "In production facilities, rodent control is a major concern. Rodents (mice and rats) vector disease, damage buildings, reduce feed efficiency, increase mortality, etc. in animal production facilities. These pests are naturally found in the surrounding environment and they become an issue when they move from their natural environment to production facilities.",
		"Problem": "Currently, the industry uses baits placed in bait stations in intervals surrounding the perimeter of the production facility and immediately adjacent to the building. Once the rodent enters the building, it becomes a challenge to eliminate the pest. Baits are not allowed inside the buildings and traps require continuous monitoring to ensure that they are ready to do their job and to remove dispatched rodents. The use of baits is a concern due to secondary poisoning.  Non-target species are sometime killed from eating a rodent that may have consumed a rodent that has consumed bait but have not died yet. There are traps that can catch numerous mice. The issue with these is that they require routine monitoring and cleaning.  A multiple catch trap for rats does not exist.",
		"Objectives": "Engineer a station that can be placed on the perimeter of a building that would be more inviting to the rodents and dispatch them before they move to the building and self-clean.  The other option is to produce a trap that will catch the rodents and self-clean/reset to be ready to catch again. The perimeter station would utilize the rodents’ natural tendencies to attract them to the station; a way to dispatch the rodent and dispose would also need to be considered. Additionally, it is important to measure rodent pressure in the area. A data logging of activity would be needed along with trend over time.",

		"Project Title": "Portable Assessment of Autonomic Function",
		"Background": "One of the most common complications of diabetes is nerve injury or neuropathy. This has been difficult to study as there are few objective tests of peripheral nerve function.  Many of the existing tests of neuropathy specifically look at autonomic function but they involve expensive testing equipment that is not widely available. Finding a more cost effective measure of autonomic function would be a valuable probe for neuropathy.",
		"Problem": "One of the function of the autonomic nerves is the control of sweating. The current gold standard for assessment of sweating is covering the skin with a mixture of corn starch and iodine which changes color in the presence of water.  Other existing methods involve heating the skin and measuring the amount of water in the gas above the skin.",
		"Objectives": "The purpose of this project is to explore whether a simple IR thermopile sensor or an inexpensive thermal imager such as the FLIR One can be used to measure sweating which will lower the temperature of the skin.  The basic principle is that as skin in a normal person is warmed by infrared light, sweating will occur that will reduce the rate of rise in temperature compared to a patient with neuropathy in which normal sweating does not occur. It will also be true that rate of recovery of the temperature toward baseline after infrared heating is discontinued will be faster in patient that sweat than in   patients that cannot. The specific question to be addressed is whether the heating and cooling curves as measured for example by a thermopile sensor after heating with an infrared light source can be used to estimate the degree of sweating. The first set of experiments can be carried out on skin colored papers with different water content. This will allow proof of concept.  In subsequent investigations, after IRB approval this can be tested on humans. Testing involving the thermopile sensor will involve signal conditioning and control of an infrared light source and then data processing.   In order for such a device to be economic it may be useful to construct this using Arduino based technology. If the initial tests are encouraging, then tests using an infrared imager such as the FLIR one would start with the algorithms developed in the first phase to process each pixel of the thermal images recorded over time to produce a map of water content.",

		"Short Summary (final text)": "The rise in the predominance of diabetes and affiliated complications can be related with compelling burdens on a patient’s quality of life and with great costs. As one of the most common diabetic complications, peripheral neuropathy (PN) affects over half of patients. PN affects both the small and large fiber nerve network within the human body and results in a loss of nerve function, which may lead to further health complications. Neuro-Neers Technologies focuses on developing a cost effective diagnostic tool to quantifiably detect the functionality of small nerve fibers by measuring the body’s ability to thermoregulate by sweating.

		"Project Title": "Vibration Device for Quantification of Neuropathy",
		"Background": "Although neuropathy is a common problem it is difficult to quantify.  Different processes affect different sized axons and hence different types of sensation. The largest sensory fibers are generally involved in vibration perception and the smallest in pain perception.",
		"Problem": "Quantifying vibration perception at different frequencies may be useful as a clinical tool, but the first step is a simple device that can allow this type of testing. It is also possible that the size of the point of contact between the probe and the skin also has an effect on the ability to perceive vibration since probes with a very tiny point of contact generally produce painful sensations (a pin) while larger ones are needed for high frequency vibration perception.",
		"Objectives": "The key element in this project will be to create a device that will be able to vibrate at frequencies between 2 and 2000Hz and will allow for constant controllable displacement that is relatively independent of contact pressure. This could be done with a solenoid and feedback control system using a microprocessor. The first step in this project is producing the device. The second step, after IRB approval is obtained, is to determine the displacement thresholds for perception at different frequencies and different contact areas.  There is existing literature regarding the pure effect of frequency on threshold but not on the effect of contact area.  A third part of this project in the future could be to test the results on patients with clinically diagnosed neuropathy.",

		"Short Summary (final text)": "70% of diabetic patients develop signs of neuropathy, a loss of sensation due to nerve damage. This could lead to foot ulcerations or accelerated deterioration of injury after falling (commonly seen with seniors); in worst case scenario, amputations. To provide an upgrade in diagnosing nerve sensory perception failure, team Vibronerv is designing an electronic device in replacement of the century old technique practiced by doctors across the nation, namely the tuning fork test. By creating a wireless prototype that monitors three critical variables: vibration frequency (generated between 2 to 2000Hz), displacement, and pressure; neurologists will be able to quantify neuropathy subjectively. The next step is to conduct IRB approved testings as to determine the vibrational perception thresholds amongst both healthy and neuropathy sample groups.",

		"Project Title": "Microwave Bridge to UC Sierra",
		"Background": "Yosemite National Park is comprised of 750,000 acres or 1200 square miles. Between four and five million domestic and international visitors visit the park every year. In 1972, a non-profit environmental education program was begun, called the Yosemite Institute – now known as NatureBridge.  Over the last 45 years, NatureBridge has provided nature education for over one million young people.  For the last five years, NatureBridge has been building a new residential campus in Yosemite. The campus, located at Henness Ridge will be LEED Platinum, energy net zero, and universally ADA accessible. The campus is called the National Environmental Science Center (NESC).  The University of California is collaborating with NatureBridge to use the campus in the summer time, beginning in the summer of 2018, which will be called UC Sierra.",
		"Problem": "For the University of California to be able to teach to 21st Century standards on this remote campus, we must bring in high-speed, broad-band internet of the highest standard. The model campus has been almost exclusively funded through donation: $53 million. However, access to state of the art internet has not yet been funded or a system yet designed.  Elsewhere, in the park, the National Park Service has spent the last 15 years developing a cutting edge telecommunication infrastructure, tying the different villages of the park together with the outside world for radio, voice over IP, telephone, and internet. The inter-tie is achieved by transmitting voice and data through microwave links between mountaintop repeaters. As yet, there is no tie-in between the Henness Ridge site and the park microwave system.",
		"Objectives": "This team will work under the guidance of Yosemite’s telecommunications manager and former chief ranger to design a state of the art microwave solution for linking the UC Sierra campus with public internet and the University of California IT system.   This capstone team, once successful, will effectively design perhaps the finest Internet backbone system for a learning center in the National Park Service. It will allow our UC summer students and NatureBridge students access to remote learning, teaching from the cloud, linkage to the world-class University of California digital library, and the ability to stream lectures in and out, in real-time. This system will benefit millions of young people over the hundred-year lifespan of the campus. Further, this system can serve as a model for bringing high- level educational digital service to remote settings anywhere in the world where access is still a problem. Members of this team must be willing to do some work in Yosemite: perhaps three meetings.",

		"Project Title": "Improved Efficiency of XCPC-Solar Composting Toilets and Potable Water Access for Cold Climates",
		"Background": "Yosemite National Park is comprised of 750,000 acres or 1200 square miles.  Four million domestic and international visitors visit the park every year. The overall area of the park includes over 706,000 acres of backcountry, designated by congress as formal wilderness. A wilderness designation means that the National Park Service must – by law - manage the area in such a way that only essential permanent structures may be maintained.   In the United States, wilderness is the highest form of land management protection and as such, provides a perfect testing environment for  sustainable engineering.   Beyond the developed infrastructure of the popular front-country visitor areas in Yosemite – there are over 706,000 acres of wilderness backcountry. This immense area is accessed by over 800 miles of hiking and stock trails enjoyed by 57,000 users - for a total of 155,000 user-nights each year. Over the decades, the Park Service has evolved the use of composting toilets in spots in the backcountry where camping use is heavy and other forms of waste management are environmentally unsound.",
		"Problem": "To date, no form of commercially available composting toilet is suitable to the task.  In theory, the combination of microbial action with heat in digestion chambers should convert solid waste into inert ash that is safe to handle and dispose of. In practice – because of heavy use and inadequate design – backcountry facility managers are forced to haul liquid waste slurry out of the backcountry on livestock for disposal in conventional dumpsites. This practice is patently unsafe for the environment, should an accident occur with livestock; and poses potential health risks to handlers, and contamination potential in watershed streams. It is also expensive, time-consuming, and places unnecessary impacts on the wilderness environment. This would be the fourth phase of a multi-phase project: the target of this group will be to advance the progress of last semester’s project to design the system reactor and in such a way as to: maximize heat transfer from the medium into the interior of the reactor chamber and verify biological kill of any surrogate pathogens, develop the snow-melting function of the system to provide a safe potable water utility, and perfect (harden) the infrastructure, and shipping shell to ready the system for field testing.",
		"Objectives": "Design an off-grid reliable and inexpensive solution to existing, commercially available composting toilets and a system option for melting snow to produce safe water without burning biomass or fossil fuels in remote locals where access to safe water in the winter is difficult. The design should be considered in modularized forms that lend themselves to easy transportation to remote sites and assembly in wilderness environments.  Materials should be envisioned to withstand environmental extremes of low temperature, humidity, seismicity, and wind. Accordingly, this redesign will have positive consequences for similarly situated park waste management challenges around the world. Likewise, there will be intentional positive applications with organizations such as the UN and poverty-fighting field programs of NGO’s (such as the World Bank) working to support emerging societies with remote communities facing challenges of human waste management, clean water, reduction of disease, and human conflict.",

		"Background": "In order for UC Merced to achieve its zero landfill waste goal by 2020, the UC Merced Recycling program has a team of Recycling/Composting interns that manually sort through waste on campus to segregate it according to compostable, recyclable, and landfill materials in efforts to increase waste diversion. Although this program is successful, there is opportunity to streamline certain processes. Currently, the campus has a solar-powered tractor that the UC Merced Recycling program would like to utilize for its compost program.",

		"Objectives": "Innovate a design to utilize solar energy as a renewable resource to power the bin lifter, improve safety of student interns by eliminating the need for manual labor to push the lifter to a power source or the need to create electric circuits using power cables and batteries, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using solar energy for electricity rather than taking electricity from the grid, this will be a great project for engineers interested in sustainability, machine design, solar energy, circuit theory, CAD drafting, and workplace safety",

		"Short Summary (final text)": "As part of UC Merced’s Triple-Zero Commitment of zero landfill waste by 2020, the UCM Recycles team sorts compost from all upper campus waste, and tips it into a dumpster using a battery-powered electric hydraulic bin lift. The two options for charging involve either 1) pushing the lift about 300 yards to the nearest power outlet or 2) connecting to a pickup truck battery using jumper cables -- both of which are inconvenient and potentially hazardous options. By pairing a solar panel and battery system previously designed for UCM Recycles with the bin lift, the safety, convenience, and energy efficiency of the composting program will be improved.",

		"Project Title": "Waste Gas and Thermal Load Level Biosensor",
		"Background": "The UC Merced Department of Animal Research Services (DARS) would like to monitor waste gas (ammonia, CO2) and thermal load levels in rodent cages for an extended period of time. Ammonia, carbon dioxide and heat levels rise in rodent cages with an increased number of animals in the cage and with longer cage change intervals. These increased levels can have detrimental effects on animal health.   There are industry-accepted standards of animal care for cage density and cage change frequency. These “engineering standards” are listed in the eighth edition of the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (the Guide). If we choose to deviate from these “engineering standards” we must have institution specific data to support our decision to deviate, thus defining our own “performance based” standards for animal care. A previous Capstone Team developed a biosensor device used to collect and log data using thermal, ammonia, and carbon dioxide sensors. We are interested in further developing and programming this biosensor to be capable of collecting and logging daily data for up to a four-week period. The data collected will allow DARS to adjust husbandry practices to be more cost effective while still providing appropriate animal welfare. Background – DARS:   DARS is a team of professionals committed to the advancement of science in collaboration with the research community by promoting the humane care and use of animals used in biomedical research and teaching.   DARS provides animal husbandry and veterinary services to the research community at UC Merced. Trio mating (1M and 2F) of mice for biomedical research  has been a popular breeding scheme used for decades. Mating mice in trios allows faculty researchers to produce twice the number of mice using half the number of cages allowing research to proceed at a faster rate and at a lower cost.",
		"Problem": "The Guide has new minimum space recommendations for commonly used rodents housed in groups and for females with litters. In a recent accreditation site visit the site visitors provided us with a suggestion for improvement of our animal care program to reevaluate our practice of trio mating. We have provided statistical breeding information showing no detrimental effects of trio mating. However it was suggested that we provide institution specific health related data to support our decision. We would like to provide waste gas and thermal load level data along with animal health diagnostics in support of our decision to use trio mating practices. Secondly, with the invention and utilization of Individually Ventilated Caging Systems cage change frequency has been pushed from one week to two weeks routinely industry wide. Changing rodent cages less frequently is more cost efficient both in terms of technician time and utilities costs. However, as cage change frequency is pushed out longer and as cage density increases waste gas and thermal load levels may reach an unhealthy state.",
		"Objectives": "Here is a list of things that are needed to improve the device: Increasing battery life and/or reducing energy expenditure from the sensors and shields. Current battery life is approximately 17-18 hours and sleep mode does not seem to be fully operating. We would like the biosensor to take readings once a day for up to four weeks and log the data. Improving 3D printouts. The loft insert needs a more organized layout for the large battery and to house the sensors in a neater configuration. The biosensor code and calibration code could use a bit more refinement for sensor readings and data logging. An alternate power source may be an option if battery life cannot be extended appropriately.",

		"Short Summary (final text)": "The UC Merced Department of Animal Research Services (DARS) is trying to deviate from the standards of the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (the Guide) by using a breeding technique called trio mating. This involves having one male mouse and two female mice in a cage in order to produce more mice in less time. To justify this, DARS needs a device that can monitor levels of carbon dioxide, ammonia, and temperature with little disturbance to the mice and which can also provide easily accessible data. By using this device, they will be able to record these levels to ensure that waste gasses do not reach hazardous levels and have specific data to justify their methods of housing mice.",

		"Project Title": "Mobile Grazing Cell",
		"Background": "Grass-Fed beef has moved from a fad to a trend by passing the 5% share of market threshold. Sales exceeded 7% of total beef sales in 2016 and continues to grow at a rapid 20% plus per year rate. Currently, 85% of grassfed beef consumed in the United States is imported. In addition to various human health benefits associated with grass fed beef, there are significant soil health benefits IF cattle are managed in a way that mimics natural systems. This process is referred to as biomimicry. When biomimicry grazing is implemented, maximum soil health, herd health, and profitability is achieved.",
		"Problem": "The current method for biomimicry grazing is to use a process called management intensive rotational grazing. It works by concentrating cattle into much smaller areas to get many of the biomimicry benefits. However, the daily moving of cattle requires a tremendous amount of manual labor. This fact increases costs and decreases the propensity to adopt a biomimicry based grazing system. Here is a video by a grazer that shows this process: https://youtu.be/sNbgcY3tk7s",
		"Objectives": "Design and test a system for automation of biomimicry grazing that combines mobile cattle fencing, water supply, and shade while at the same time allowing for data acquisition in real time. In addition, each of the biomimicry aspects such as tightly herded, constantly moving, eating only ½ of the grass, evenly dispersed manure, and even surface disturbance must be addressed. Resource needs, best location, and timeline for implementation are desired. The current base unit for this project is a single span of an overhead irrigation system with two towers. There is a hot wire fence suspended from the overhead tower along with a shade mounted to the top of the tower. Some critical design elements that are needed to create a complete grazing cell include: drinking water system for cattle, fencing system capable of working over uneven terrain, shade available for cattle to avoid heat stress, power source for the automated fencing system, unit control and data management with the capability of remote operation, portability and modularity.",

		"Background": "Super Insulated Green Building Technologies LLC of Flagstaff Arizona, along with developing partner T3 Energy of Australia, is currently working on new cellular structures for highly insulated, load bearing residential construction materials. SIGBT seeks to develop the next generation product (a residential, exterior load bearing wall system) by first improving product tolerances for vertical load bearing capabilities with in kind tightening of horizontal thermal regulation. Further application of improvements to newly conceptualized roof and floor systems will net much greater efficiency gains and the opportunity to close in on net zero housing at a scalable level.",
		"Problem": "SIGBT and T3Energy apply the concept of utilizing one primary wall material as both insulation and load bearing structure in order to reduce construction materials, labor and costs required to achieve outstanding energy efficiency. When one material is used as both structure and insulation there is generally a trade-off between the two resulting in one being compromised by the other and neither being optimized.  We propose that this need not necessarily be the case.The concept relies on the fact that in housing the desired direction of the resistance to heat flow and the desired direction of structural strength are mutually perpendicular, with insulating requirement being horizontal through the wall and the structural requirement being predominately vertical. We propose that it should therefore be possible to optimize both of these two characteristics without the direct trade off described above.",
		"Objectives": "For the purposes of this project we suggest that it may be possible to achieve the desired outcome by design of the air cell geometry specifically for the direction of the characteristic required. The air cells should be closed and have no spaces between cells in order to prevent air infiltration and thermal convection from compromising efficiency. The wall material defining the air cells should be of non-combustible material for maximum fire safety. We have chosen at this stage not to specify the wall thickness of the air cells or the other  dimensions  and  geometry  so  that  these  can   be   theoretically optimized. However, we note that the small size (around1 mm or less) of air cells in conventional insulation is probably not optimum and more the result of material properties and processes. Double glazing air gaps are optimized at around 12 mm.  This is more likely to be a better scale for air cells. The desired horizontal insulation rating for a 300 mm (12 inch) block is greater than R50.The desired vertical structural strength is greater than a yield load of 200kPa",

		"Project Title": "Hot Water Pest Eradicator",
		"Background": "Insects, bacteria, and parasites are usually prevalent on any plant grown under normal outdoor conditions. Plants are typically treated with chemical pesticides in order to rid the plant of harmful pests, but these treatments are toxic to humans, expensive for growers, and harmful to the environment. Researchers at the University of Hawaii at Manoa have found that treating plants with hot water under controlled conditions can eliminate pests while doing little to no damage to the plant. The University of California Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources is working with the Center for Applied Horticultural Research in San Diego County in hopes of using this technique to eliminate the need for pesticides used on nursery and floricultural plants.",
		"Problem": "Different pests were found to have different tolerances to hot water treatments depending on the temperature of the water and the length of the treatment process. Most pests that were tested were killed when using water between 113°F and 122°F for treatment periods lasting between 5 and 15 minutes. The control system for the treatment container will have to be able to control the temperature of the water and the timeframe of the treatment period within these constraints.",
		"Objectives": "The purpose of this project is to build a closed treatment container which plants can be loaded into and treated with hot water. The container will employ several dozen spray nozzles for complete coverage of the plants inside. The treatment container will also need to be equipped with a controller to control the temperature of the water and the duration of the treatment. The system will use a series of heaters, pumps, and water storage containers to make the water easily controllable. In addition, the system can employ sensors and other sophisticated technology to make the target variables more accurate and easily achievable. Please provide detailed schematic drawings and prototype diagrams of the system.",

		"Project Title": "Gait/Audio recording Interpreter",
		"Background": "Gait analysis is a common technique used in biomechanics to identify medical problems related to an individual’s ability to walk. Currently, there is an abundance of video gait analysis systems that are extremely expensive and make gait analysis out of reach for most  physician  or  PT offices. ",
		"Problem": "However, gait generally involves a regular set of events Heel-Strike on one foot followed by toe-off on that foot followed by Heel-strike and toe off on the other foot. The regularity of this pattern can be used to our advantage. At heel strike there is a clear contact with the floor and so generates sound. When the foot hits the ground between heel strike and toe-off there is a second sound. A quantitative analysis of these aspects can give a quick and cheap indicator of how severely abnormal a persons gait is. Listening to other things such as the noise from shuffling can provide additional information.",
		"Objectives": "Design and test a system to analyze human gait using only sound sensors instead of video. The system should be able to acquire and process data from the sound sensors and present it in a comprehensible way as a basis for diagnosis. The system should use off-the-shelf components, be relatively portable, inexpensive, and easy to use. It should also be able to analyze a wide variety of gaits under the same conditions. A feasibility analysis, implementation plan, list of parts and components, drawings and schematics, and preliminary tests are expected.",

		"Project Title": "Emergency Tunnel Ventilation Fan",
		"Background": "Underground stations and tunnels over 1,000 feet in length are required to have mechanical ventilation for a fire emergency as per NFPA 130. These fans are typically operated and monitored remotely by the Operations Control Center, (OCC) however, local operation is possible. These fans have two operational modes, supply and exhaust. Supply is when air is drawn in from above ground and blown into the tunnel system. Exhaust is simply the reverse of Supply where the tunnel system air is discharged to the atmosphere.",
		"Problem": "During an emergency, numerous fans will be activated in a supporting combination of Supply and Exhaust modes. If one or more fans are operating in the wrong direction the loss of life and property can be high. Therefore, it is imperative that the air flow direction indicated on the OCC display screen accurately displays the field conditions. BART and other agencies in the U.S. have been known to have had OCC display screen discrepancies with respect to actual field conditions. Therefore, an air flow sensing and monitoring system is needed as a source of verifying air flow direction.",
		"Objectives": "Design an air flow sensing and monitoring system that will indicate air flow direction, motor rotation and provide input into our local SCADA system. Design and submit, for approval schematic diagrams and Equipment Drawings. Provide all drawings and schematics in AutoCAD readable format (.dwg). Develop proto-type drawings and commissioning procedures. Coordinate with BART staff for installation and commissioning. This project will allow BART to ensure that the equipped fan is operating in the correct mode.",

		"Project Title": "Train Washer Nozzles Plugging",
		"Background": "BART currently has 4 train washers that service 669 train cars. Approximately 200 train cars are washed daily at each location. The purpose of cleaning the trains is multifaceted. The main however is for customer satisfaction and overall appearance. Washing also helps to prevent corrosion by removing rail dust, brake dust and other corrosives collected while in service.",
		"Problem": "The train washer solution is mainly comprised of Sodium Hydroxide with a pH of 13. This solution is sprayed onto the cars via 20 stainless steel eyelet type nozzles. As these nozzles wear and become clogged the spray pattern has diminishes such that virtually no solution is being emitted resulting in streaking on the car body. Therefore, instead of replacing the old nozzles with the same nozzles we would like to completely remove and replace the old with new.",
		"Objectives": "Design a new chemical delivery system for BART’s four train washers. Provide a design such that the proper flowrates and spray coverage are achieved. Provide recommendations on nozzle types and material that do not clog or erode due to the harsh chemicals. Provide recommended preventative maintenance procedures. Design and submit, for approval, all new nozzles, material specifications, mounting brackets and locations, and tube routing. Prepare commissioning procedures. Provide all drawings and schematics in AutoCAD readable format (.dwg). Coordinate with BART staff to install proto-type and commission.

Because the water is gravity fed, manually operated, and highly complex, fluctuations in flow rate and water level develop as water moves down the system. These fluctuations cause what is referred to as “operational spills” to the various natural waterways surrounding the District. Given the increasing importance of conserving water, the District is committed to reducing these spills. ",
		"Problem": "One established method of reducing these fluctuations has been to locate what the District refers to as a pump-back reservoir at the end of a canal. This reservoir captures what would normally spill from the canal and, when needed, pumps that water back to a location farther up the canal where it can be used. This can help prevent shortages on the canal system and insures that all water goes towards its intended use.",
		"Objectives": "Given a pre-selected location at the end of the District’s Lower Lateral 2 canal, design a pump- back reservoir that will capture spill from the canal and use it to stabilize flows upstream. Determine the critical specifications of the reservoir such as storage capacity, cost of construction, time to construct, spill water saved, and intake and discharge capacity. Develop conceptual drawings of the reservoir for presentation to the Irrigation Capital Planning team.",

		"Project Title": "Upper Lateral 4 Irrigation Canal Flow Modeling",
		"Background": "The Turlock Irrigation District has a complex system of canals used to convey water via gravity flow from our reservoirs in the foothills. Because the water is gravity fed, the district relies on drop structures in each canal to regulate water level to a sufficient height to serve surrounding agricultural ground. ",
		"Problem": "Over the last century that the District’s canals have been in operation there have been many changes to both drop structures and canals, each modification designed to achieve a specific goal without reference to the operation of the overall canal or system of canals. While not affecting current operations, these spot changes have often led to unequal flow capacity on the canal system. In many locations it is possible to improve performance of the canal system by locating and removing “choke points” that have been created.",

		"Background": "The Turlock Irrigation District has a complex system of canals used to convey water via gravity flow from our reservoirs in the foothills. Because the water is gravity fed, manually operated, and highly complex, fluctuations in flow rate and water level develop as water moves down the system. These fluctuations cause what is referred to as “operational spills” to the various natural waterways surrounding the District. Given the increasing importance of conserving water, the District is committed to reducing these spills. ",
		"Problem": "One proven method of reducing these fluctuations has been to locate a regulating reservoir at a point farther down the system to act as a “flow reset” point. The reservoir draws water out of the canal system when flows are higher than they are supposed to be and discharges water into the canal when flows are lower. In this way, it balances the flow in the canal and removes water that would ultimately spill, using it to improve customer service by preventing shortages.",

For peaches, we pick them ripe, size them, peel them, and slice and dice them.  Keeping costs low and being good stewards of the environment support our goals.",

Historically pits were dumped into the SF bay (pre-1939), dumped into landfills, used to make charcoal filters in WWI, re-purposed into fire logs, or burned in biomass plants. With the elimination of state incentives, biomass plants are closing in California.  With more supply than demand, this by-product may end up, once again, filling our landfills.",

		"Project Title": "UC Merced SE2 Outdoor Seating Environment",
		"Background": "The Science and Engineering Building 2 (SE2) opened in the fall of 2015 with a LEED Platinum rating. The building features many open public areas that are well lit and inviting for students and staff alike to use as study, meeting, or lounging space. Some of the amenities include shelter from the elements, and access to power for charging electronic devices. ",
		"Problem": "As the campus expands and reworks some of its existing space there are plans to transform a portion of the 1st floor/lobby area of the building by installing a coffee and snack bar. In order to accommodate the increased foot traffic the School of Engineering would like a detailed plan for an outdoor public area that would integrate seamlessly with the current, indoor area and provide the same kind of amenities.",
		"Objectives": "Design and evaluate an outdoor public area on the ground floor outside SE2 for common use. Some of the required features for this area are shelter from the environment conditions throughout the year (wind, rain, heat, sun, etc.), some degree of climate control, and access to power to charge electronic devices. The goal is to provide an outdoor area that is comfortable and protected such that students and staff will be inclined to use it regularly. The proposed solution should be visually appealing and in keeping with the overall visual look of the SE2 and the campus. It should also continue the efforts of minimal environmental impact.",

		"Project Title": "Pullet Transfer",
		"Background": "The backbone of a successful poultry breeding program involves the careful management of male (cockerel) and female (pullet) birds. This includes the management of proper inventory, male to female ratios, as well as proper food and nutrient level monitoring. Due to the time it takes for a pullet to become mature enough to produce eggs, approximately 22-24 weeks, young pullets are often raised in barns designed to solely accommodate young birds.  When mature, pullets are transferred to barns that contain nesting systems designed for the optimal safety of the eggs and ease of collection.",
		"Problem": "The pullet transfer process includes the physical movement of live pullets from one facility to another.  In terms of animal welfare, the process itself is very disturbing, and can often result in birds being frightened, or otherwise becoming excited.",
		"Objectives": "Currently the process of pullet transfers is completed using one of two methods. One method involves a large number of people to perform the manual labor of loading the birds by hand, but this process is incredible time intensive and expensive. The second method involves a pullet transfer trailer, which has been used in the industry for decades (see picture). The pullet transfer trailer involves the dumping of birds which leads to increased animal welfare concerns, which include the much higher rate of bird injury. The cost of an injured bird is very high, as approximately 22 weeks of feed have been fed to the bird, with absolutely zero return. A project designed to analyze the current methods of bird movement, and potential new methods would help the industry financially, by focusing on minimizing bird injury, and would be looked upon favorably for our animal welfare expectations.

		"Background": "The Pitman Farms processing facility operates with a short order procurement to order fulfillment cycle time. Orders for processed products are received one day, and processed and shipped the following day.  As a result of seasonal sales fluctuations, the daily expected orders can vary substantially, making the prediction of expected orders difficult.",
		"Problem": "Two robots have been installed at Pitman Farms that handle the stacking of 8 pallets worth of product at any one time. At full speed, the robots were designed to produce one complete pallet of stacked product per minute. Currently the operator, a member of the shipping department, is tasked with assigning the robots the highest volume codes that are expected throughout the day.  The problem is that the operator must use “tribal knowledge” or a Production Order List to assign codes to the robots.  This analysis is completely inefficient. ",
		"Objectives": "By studying the expected items on any particular day, and analyzing the start and stop times for an particular item, an algorithm could be made to assign items to the robots to optimize full pallets, eject pallets when the total number of items has reached the expected level, and then pull in the next item. The goal of the robots is to minimize the number of items being manually hand stacked.",

		"Project Title": "Robotic Bedding Cleaner for Poultry Farms",
		"Background": null,
		"Problem": "Commercial poultry operations use litter in their houses for bedding for their birds. The bedding is either sourced from wood chips or from rice hulls.  During the normal flock development, the litter will become moister due to fecal waste from the birds and spilled water from the drinkers.  High moisture in the litter can be detrimental to the productivity of poultry due to an increase in health issues and the presence of insects. Flies and darkling beetles are drawn to the moisture and the litter becomes a breeding site for these insects. Flies can become a nuisance issue for neighbors in some cases.   Currently, litter is treated by mechanical mixing using a rototiller to blend drier litter that is found in the house with the excessively moist litter. This mixing reduces the breeding sites available and breaks the reproductive cycle of these insects. Mechanical mixing is done at least every 3 days during the production cycle.",
		"Objectives": "The goal would be to produce a robotic method to replace the rototilling mixing operation. The advantages to the industry would be in reduced labor and improvement to the litter quality resulting in better overall performance.

		"Project Title": "Continuous Ion-Exchange Hardness Removal, Phase 2",
		"Background": "The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) possesses three sets of semi-automated ion-exchange units that are designed to soften brackish shallow groundwater. The goal of this project will be to automate the softening process while producing water with little to no hardness. The California aqueduct provides water supplies for the west side of the San Joaquin Valley from the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. During drought years, water for farming is expensive and/or unavailable. Shallow groundwater exists throughout the farming area (1,700,000 acres) but is of little value due to elevated salt concentrations. Calcium concentrations range from 200 mg/L to 650 mg/L, and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) concentrations are from 1,800 mg/L to 5,000 mg/L (Magnesium concentrations range from 50 mg/L to 150 mg/L). To desalt this water for agricultural purposes, we have operated the ion-exchange units to soften brackish water prior to treatment using a vapor compression distillation (VCD) unit that emphasizes energy conservation. The VCD unit is mobile and has treated a wide range of water qualities. DWR has determined that the VCD unit cannot accommodate calcium; therefore, it is imperative to pretreat the water using a softening method.  The method chosen was ion-exchange. ",
		"Problem": "DWR has had success with a manually operated softening system that consisted of three vessels in series.  Each vessel had a volume capacity of 3 ft3.  DWR is currently looking to fully automate the new system and integrate an in-line hardness monitor to actuate the regeneration cycle on each of the three ion-exchange units.  The use of the hardness monitor will improve the efficiency of salt use during the regeneration cycle and account for TDS variability in the brackish water encountered in the field.  DWR has two systems available to modify. The systems have a design flow of approximately 3.5 GPM with minimal calcium breaking through. Last year UC Merced staff and students were able to develop a prototype system utilizing a Hach SP-510 hardness monitor that initiated the regeneration cycle for one ion-exchange valve.  This year, DWR would like UC Merced to further develop the current prototype to include two ion-exchange valves.  The two valves are to work in unison so that a continuous flow of water can be softened without interruption. Utilizing another ion-exchange control valve (provided by DWR) will allow the entire ion-exchange system to operate under continuous flow conditions.  Under these operating conditions, one ion-exchange unit will soften water (treatment cycle) while the other will operate through a cycle consisting of a rinse, regeneration, and a final rinse (regeneration cycle).  Upon completion of the regeneration cycle, the system will be on standby until the other ion-exchange unit is exhausted and is ready to enter its own regeneration cycle.",
		"Objectives": "This task is to be accomplished by using the existing hardness monitor. It will be necessary to add a series of control valves for the source water, treated water, and water entering the hardness monitor. We believe that UC Merced staff and students have the capability to continue modifying the existing prototype to meet the above mentioned criteria.  Additional control valves will be needed so the system can operate on a continual basis and for an extended period of time without the need of staff being on-site to monitor and manually control valves.",

		"Background": "Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) carry great promises for the inspection of the widely spread assets of gas and electricity utilities.",
		"Problem": "However, one of the limitations imposed by the regulator today is to fly within the line of sight of the operator in order to assure a permanent active control and supervision of the UAS. Such a limitation reduces considerably the potential of UAS for the inspection of long linear assets such as pipelines and power lines. To assure the permanent active control of the UAS beyond the line of sight of the operator, the device must be in communication with the operator. The limitation is then the range of its radio-telecommunication limited by the horizon as seen by the antenna of the operator station.",

		"Project Title": "Blanched Almond Wet Room Optimization",
		"Background": "Headquartered in Sacramento, California, Blue Diamond Growers is the world’s largest almond processing and marketing company. Founded in 1910, the cooperative is owned by half of the state’s almond growers who produce over 80 percent of the world almond supply. In 2013, we doubled our capacity by opening the first phase of a new plant in Turlock, California, designed to create more value-added global products using state-of-the art technology. Blanch Lines 1 and 2 produce over 60 million pounds of pasteurized blanched almonds annually.  The raw almonds are introduced into the processing line, rinsed, cleaned of foreign material, and pasteurized employing a thermal process scalder to heat the almonds to 190 degrees Fahrenheit for a minimum time of 90 seconds, an accepted proprietary process of the Technical Expert Review Panel’s (TERP) pasteurization treatment for raw almonds. See picture below (Figure 1) for reference.  The TERP acceptance process is specific to equipment and operating procedures.  Modifications in design, configuration, or throughput would require revalidation for acceptance.  Our current TERP speeds are qualified at 9040 lbs/hour.",
		"Problem": "The current Maseto scalder uses a submerged drag chain conveyor and paddle system at a fixed speed and throughput rate to ensure the almonds achieve those temperatures in accordance with the accepted TERP pasteurizer process.  There are a lot of reliability and maintenance issues with a hot water and steam delivery system.  A complete redesign of the system is needed to ensure that instances of “pasteurizer failure” are reduced by 50% of the recorded FY2014 occurrences. ",
		"Objectives": "The goal of the project is to conduct appropriate research and prepare a Design of Experiment (DoE) to verify how the system will react under varying test conditions with and without thermal pre-conditioning.  Students will prepare a plumbing and instrumentation diagram (P&ID) of the existing system and make recommendations on changes to the system equipment and controls. The DoE results could then be used to develop a process flow diagram and equipment recommendations to achieve the 50 percent reduction in downtime for the blanch lines. A secondary benefit would also include reducing water usage, energy savings, and developing a more reliable system of delivery for the hot water/steam mixture to the scalder.",

		"Short Summary (final text)": "At the Blue Diamond Grower’s Turlock processing plant, raw almonds are introduced into the processing line, rinsed with 160 degree water, and then pasteurized at 190 degrees Fahrenheit in a steam scalder. From there the almonds continue through the line to be blanched, cut, dried and packaged. Our problem is centered on the pre-rinse water delivery system, which is currently the cause of much downtime in the blanched almond lines. The primary issue is the length of time that is needed for the supply tank to reach the operating temperature of 160 degrees Fahrenheit. Secondary quality concerns relate to the color of the recirculating rinse water which darkens continuously in the current system. Our mission is to design a system to supply hot water to the production line, meeting quality standards, and reducing downtime by at least 50% of the downtime of the current system.",

		"Project Title": "Peach Peeling Efficiency",
		"Background": "Del Monte Foods Modesto plant is the flagship plant for Del Monte fruit, producing over 25 million cases of fruit each year. Adding value for the consumer is a key to our success. For peaches, we pick them ripe, size them, peel them, and slice and dice them.  Keeping costs low and being good stewards of the environment support our goals.  ",
		"Problem": "The peeling process utilizes a strongly alkaline hydrophilic substance (KOH and hot water) to dissolve the peel. If this process is not optimized, then the KOH is over-used. Excess is discharged to a pH neutralization system.  A strong acid must be used to bring the pH down in order to discharge the water from the plant. If the concentration is too high or the duration of discharge is too long, the existing neutralization system may be overloaded, causing downtime and extra costs.",
		"Objectives": "The first step is to learn the process of using KOH to peel peaches. Draw the existing system to see how it is currently designed. Find inefficiencies and propose design changes that will reduce KOH use, limit high pH to the neutralization system, and still optimize the peeling of peaches.  Provide measuring points and metrics to ensure the system stays efficient.",

		"Project Title (final text)": "Peach Peeling Efficiency",
		"Short Summary (final text)": "The Peach Perfect team aims to optimize a commercial peach-peeling process that uses a lye solution to remove peach skins. We’re providing an analysis of the current system to pinpoint inefficiencies and try to quantify the deterioration of the recirculated lye over time. During peach-peeling season — from about June 15 to Sept. 15 — the system is in operation 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with a day taken every two or three weeks to manually clean the system. Major areas of concern in the process are the effluent neutralization, where acid is added to the basic effluent, and yield loss, or the difference in weight between a batch of peaches before and after they are peeled. Quantitatively being able to determine when the recirculated lye is no longer efficient at peeling would enable our sponsor to better plan for the neutralization of effluent from the process and minimize yield loss.",

To achieve industry standards, skilled workers need precision equipment such as variable speed turntables to properly, quickly and accurately weld components. But current turntables lack integrated clutches, so welders cannot freely rotate parts or assemblies. In addition, the high-frequency electric motors on the turntables can interfere with certain welding equipment. We are designing an easily integrated clutch that allows welders to seamlessly engage or disengage turntables from their motors during operation, so the parts or assemblies can be moved freely without interfering with welding equipment.",

		"Project Title": "Tomato Harvester for Fresh Market Tomatoes, Phase II",
		"Background": "Fresh market tomatoes, such as those found on commercial food industry burgers, sandwiches, tacos and salads, are currently picked by hand. They are picked green and are allowed to ripen and turn red as they reach their destination, similar to the way bananas are handled. Fresh market tomatoes have a supply chain life of approximately 3 to 4 weeks. By contrast, all processing tomatoes, such as those used for ketchup, salsa, pastes and sauce, are picked when fully ripe and by a harvesting machine.",
		"Problem": "There is a huge demand for a mechanical tomato harvester that can pick fresh market tomatoes without bruising and damaging the tomatoes. The tomato harvester works for the processing tomatoes because they are steamed and peeled and processed the same day they are harvested. If current tomato harvesters were used to harvest fresh market tomatoes the damage and bruising would show up by the time the end user and buyer received their shipment and the load would be at risk for being rejected. The goal of this project is to modify an existing harvester to successfully harvest fresh market tomatoes which would revolutionize this aspect of the industry. The demand for such a machine would be regional as well as widespread nationally.",
		"Objectives": "Last semester, a capstone team designed and built a prototype (shown to the right) to separate the tomatoes from their stems, a critical part of the harvesting process. The next step is to design additional components of a prototype harvesting machine that incorporates the previous team’s new separation technology. Design considerations include determining how the plants will be removed from the ground and carried to the separation technology, how the separation components will interface with the plants, and then what happens to the fruit and plants after separation. This critical next project will bring us one step closer to an efficient and economical fresh market tomato harvester that could revolutionize the industry.",

		"Project Title": "MicroCT ScannerCalibration",
		"Background": "Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the major medical imaging scanners available in most hospitals. CT is used to image the internal structures noninvasively by scanning patients with high energy X-ray photons. While CT has been emerged for a long time, it is still an active research topic. MicroCT is the small-scaled CT and is dedicated for small animal imaging. It has the same imaging components such as data acquisition board, motor controllers and reconstruction algorithms as those in a CT. MicroCT scanners are available in most small animal imaging facility and research centers. In a CT scanner, an X-ray tube generates high energy X-ray photons and a detector is mounted on the opposite side for sensing the X-ray photons. To have a good CT image, the CT system parameters such as the positions of the X-ray tube and detector should be calibrated precisely. And the detector response to different X-ray tube current should be calibrated too.",
		"Problem": "There is a prototype microCT scanner in Dr. Changqing Li’s lab. All major components, such as X-ray tube, X-ray detector, rotary stage, data acquisition board, X-ray shielding box with safety lock, data acquisition software, CT reconstruction algorithms and code, are available. The calibration method and programming code are also available. ",
		"Objectives": "The ultimate goal of your team is to calibrate the microCT imaging system for good CT images. To achieve this goal, your team is required to complete following tasks in this capstone project. (1) Understand the basic principle of CT. (2) Learn the motor control code and the data acquisition code (written in C++). (3)  Understand the CT calibration method described in a paper and get familiar with the calibration code (written in MATLAB). (4) Perform the calibration experiments to obtain the system parameters such as the rotation center, the distance between x-ray tube and detector. (5)  Calibrate the X-ray detector. (6) You may use a 3D printer to print out a mounting plate to adjust the X-ray detector position. (7) Understand the CT reconstruction code written in MATLAB. Apply the calibrated parameters in the code. (8) Evaluate the CT performance with phantom experiments. (9) If possible, simplify the microCT imaging procedure. Try to automate the steps from data acquisition to a CT image. After this project, you should have solid experiences in X-ray radiation and CT imaging.",

		"Background": "Detecting the concentration of biomolecules in biological fluids is critical for diagnosing and charting the progression of disease, for monitoring the health of humans and livestock, and for determining the safety of foods and efficacy of drugs. Biosensors are devices that detect and quantify the concentration of such biomolecules. Biosensors typically require signal processing to convert nanoscale biomolecular recognition events into quantitative signals. Current biosensing techniques are fundamentally limited because they require modern electronics to convert biomolecular binding events into a quantitative signal. Applications in the field, in harsh or resource-limited environments, or during conditions of calamity present special challenges—for example the lack of critical pieces of equipment, suitably trained staff, electricity, or other sources of power. In such cases, conditions favor simpler tests such as lateral flow tests or colorimetric tests, which are often not quantitative. Even though portable electronic instruments are now available, instruments with moving parts are liable to break down or require maintenance. The lack of power-free quantitative biosensing is a significant gap in the field; thus biosensing techniques that can provide quantitative readouts without requiring electronics are extremely desirable and potentially transformative.",
		"Problem": "Successful biosensors are sophisticated pieces of technology, requiring optimization of device design for signal processing and fluid handling, material properties, and biological interactions to obtain reproducible readouts of disease markers. A multidisciplinary team will evaluate two biosensing techniques that show promise as power-free sensors: 1) a magnetic levitation device (Figure 1) 2) wicking-based flow of immunoprecipitate-laden fluids. Based on the chosen technology, students, at the minimum, will have to design and build a prototype of an integrated device that will be able to detect the concentration of bovine serum albumin (a type of protein) in distilled water. The device should be able to perform sensing with minimal specialized user intervention. The use of power or robotics to optimize sample handling, loading, parallelization, and documentation of results is allowed and encouraged. Power, however, should not be required for the core sensing technology. ",
		"Objectives": "Superlative performance in the project will be a prototype that is able to detect multiple analytes in complex fluids at clinically relevant sensitivities with minimal user intervention. Techniques that could be explored include digital microfluidics, microfluidics, micro and nanofabrication, materials selection and optimization and biological assays. ",

		"Project Title": "Mobile Biological Treatment System Design",
		"Background": null,
		"Problem": "Biological systems are highly versatile. They are able to remove significant amounts of organic and inorganic contaminants from water in a cost effective manner.  However, the reliability and capacity of biological systems to achieve treatment goals cannot be estimated effectively without conducting field tests. Therefore, it is common practice to conduct pilot studies to assess the efficacy of biological treatment process for a given application prior to full-scale implementation.The goal of this project is to design and construct a mobile biological treatment system that can be used for pilot testing in the field.  Example applications include municipal wastewater treatment, dairy/cattle farm runoff, food processing wastewater, and pump-and-treat groundwater remediation.",
		"Objectives": "(1) The pilot system must be representative of a system that can be built on a full-scale basis (e.g., 1 x 106 gal/d). (2) The pilot system must be able to treat a minimum of 100 gal/d but be portable so that it can be moved from location to location on a rented medium duty stake bed truck. (3) The pilot system must be capable of both anoxic and aerobic operation, not necessarily simultaneous.  It can be sequential. (4) The pilot system must include solids concentration or separation to produce an effluent with low suspended solids. (5) Capability for real- or near real-time monitoring of pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen in the primary treatment tank.  Real- or near real-time monitoring of effluent turbidity is highly desirable. (6) There must be provisions for influent, effluent, and in-tank water sampling.",

		"Project Title": "Improved Efficiency and Safety Design for Wilderness-Use Composting Toilets, Phase III",
		"Background": "Yosemite National Park is comprised of 750,000 acres or 1200 square miles.  Four million domestic and international visitors visit the park every year.  The overall area of the park includes over 706,000 acres of backcountry, designated by congress as formal wilderness. A wilderness designation means that the National Park Service must – by law - manage the area in such a way that no modern technology may be permanently placed within and only essential permanent structures may be maintained. In the United States, wilderness is the highest form of land management protection and exists because there is in this country a formal sense that some of our landscapes should be protected in their wild form for natural functions to occur unimpaired and for the people to enjoy.  Beyond the developed infrastructure of the popular front-country visitor areas in Yosemite – there are over 706,000 acres of wilderness backcountry. This immense area is accessed by over 800 miles of hiking and stock trails enjoyed by 57,000 users - for a total of 155,000 user-nights each year. Over the decades, the Park Service has evolved to the use of composting toilets in particular spots in the backcountry where hiking and camping use is the heaviest and other forms of waste management are environmentally unsound.",
		"Problem": "To date, no form of commercially available composting toilet is suitable to the task.  In theory, the combination of microbial action with heat in digestion chambers should convert solid waste into inert ash that is safe to handle and dispose of.  In practice – because of heavy use and inadequate design – backcountry facility managers are forced to haul liquid waste slurry out of the backcountry on livestock for disposal in conventional dumpsites. This practice is patently unsafe for the environment, should an accident occur with livestock; and poses potential health risks to handlers, and contamination potential in watershed streams. It is also expensive, time-consuming, and places unnecessary impacts on the wilderness environment.This would be the third phase of a multi-phase project: the target of this group will be to advance the progress of last semester’s project to design the system reactor and in such a way as to maximize heat transfer from the medium into the interior of the reactor chamber and verify biological kill of any surrogate pathogens.",
		"Objectives": "The goal of the project is to design an off-grid reliable and inexpensive solution to existing, commercially available composting toilets. The design should be considered in modularized forms that lend themselves to easy transportation to remote sites and assembly in wilderness environments.  Materials should be envisioned to withstand environmental extremes of low temperature, humidity, seismicity, and wind. Accordingly, this redesign will have positive consequences for similarly situated park waste management challenges around the world.  Likewise, there will be intentional positive applications with organizations such as the UN and poverty-fighting field programs of NGO’s (such as the World Bank) working to support emerging societies with remote communities facing challenges of human waste management, clean water, reduction of disease, and human conflict.",

The goal is to design a rugged, effective, solar-powered, modular product that can easily be transported to and assembled in remote wilderness areas. The toilets have to be sturdy and able to withstand extreme temperatures, weather, wind and even seismic activity. The team is also developing a collateral benefit through adaptation of this solar-based system that will produce safe drinking water from snow in cold climates without the use of fossil fuels or forest products for energy. A successful design will have positive consequences for public-park waste-management challenges around the world, and positive applications through organizations such as the United Nations and poverty-fighting field programs of non-governmental organizations, such as the World Bank, which work to help emerging societies with remote communities face the challenges of human-waste management, clean water, disease reduction and human conflict.",

		"Project Title": "Microfluidic System for Rapid Quantification of Microbial Adaptation to Oil Spills",
		"Background": "The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon (DwH) drilling rig in the northern Gulf of Mexico (NGoM) on April 20, 2010, resulted in the largest U.S. petroleum industry accident in history.  It was estimated that 4.1 million barrels of oil was released over 84 days with an estimated 60% of this reaching the sea surface.  It is well known that weathering and hydrodynamic forces affect both the distribution and properties of the crude oil released, and that opportunistic microbes play a role in its degradation.  However, few studies have examined the interactions between oil, dispersants and microbial adaption.",
		"Problem": "Environmental heterogeneity (e.g. concentration gradient) has been shown to facilitate the evolution of antibiotic resistance for bacteria and drug resistance for HIV.  Such gradients also impact source–sink dynamics in ecology to foster adaptation to the sink conditions (sanctuary).  The goal of this project is to design and build a microfluidic system that can support investigations of microbial adaption under oil/dispersant selection pressure.  With the concentration gradient (environmental heterogeneity) generated using a microfluidic system, the time needed to observe microbial response to selective pressure (oil-dispersant addition) can be greatly shortened to provide understanding and predictive capacity to assess microbe-oil/dispersant interactions around the oil spill site.",
		"Objectives": "Design and prototype a microfluidic system to impose calibrated and adjustable concentration gradients of oil/dispersant representative of ocean conditions on microbe populations.  The system should be able to: (1) Impose concentration gradients up to 1-10 ppm/mm. (2) Temperature ranges:   0-35C  (3) Sample sizes 200 µl-2 ml. (4) Polymer material used must be resistant to oil and dispersants. (5) Measurement access , preferred transparent, overall size smaller than 3 in×3 in, easy-access liquid sampling ports must be included within the device.",

It spilled 4.1 million barrels of oil, 60 percent of which reached the gulf’s surface. The goal of this project is to design a microfluidic device or devices that create concentration gradients of different values for microbial adaptation studies. The devices should generate a concentration gradient of 1-100 ppm/mm, have a temperature range of 0-30 Celsius, accommodate sample sizes of 200µl-2 ml, have easy access to sample ports, be compact for microscope use and be made of an oil-resistant polymer. Crude oil releases are treated with dispersants, which solvated crude oil deeper into the ocean, furthering exposure of marine life that lives in the water and on the ocean floor. Very few studies have analyzed the interaction between crude oil and microbes. Our particular interest is microbial adaptation to heterogeneity (concentration gradient) caused by the crude oil still present in the ocean/ocean floor.",

		"Short Summary (final text)": "The goal of this project is to create a replicable and scalable method of making restaurants more energy and water efficient. Specifically, at Gateway Gardens in Merced, the team is developing solutions to reduce fossil-fuel emissions by 50 percent. The main solution for addressing this issue is by controlling the ventilation system and the water pressure and installing a photovoltaic system on the building, all of which will reduce fossil-fuel emissions and decrease building operation costs. Gateway Gardens is launching one of the region’s first commissaries — a shared kitchen facility to allow local chefs, caterers and other food entrepreneurs easier startups by sharing resources and costs. The overall goal is to improve food options and access for Merced and surrounding areas.",

		"Problem": "Tomato harvesting is a mechanically driven operation where a harvester digs into dirt and cuts the vines. What is dug then goes through a set of tumblers to loosen and remove dirt, rocks, and vines. A vacuum is also put in place to aspirate light vines and dirt in order for tomato to finally be conveyed to a belt. The tomato then passes through a set of color sorters and the purpose of these color sorters are to remove MOT in order to have only tomato make it to the tomato trucks. Although it does remove a fraction of the MOT there is still a percentage that makes it through to the truck and inevitably to the plant which damages equipment. ",

		"Background": "Bowles Farming Company (BFCo) is committed to conserving the land we farm for generations to come. Regenerative practices such as cover cropping and the use of compost are both practices that can help promote the long term health and productivity of our soils. BFCo is interested in exploring full scale composting operations as a means to create a stable and cost effective way of providing the long term nutrient needs of the farm’s soil.",
		"Problem": "The greatest challenges we face are related to the input materials for the composting operation. Finding reliable sources for input materials can be challenging. BFCo has developed relationships with a number of potential source providers and is committed to using winter cover crops as a carbon source for composting operations. BFCo needs help creating optimal blends of source materials to best improve the needs of our farm’s soil. While selling compost on the commercial market is a part of the greater business plan, the priority and primary focus is creating optimal blends for our farm’s soils specifically. While the economics of sourcing materials are variable that must be considered in the selection of source materials, the Green House Gas (GHG) Foot Print also must be considered. BFCo wants to ensure that its operations are conducive to long term environmental stewardship.",
		"Objectives": "BFCo is seeking help in finding the solutions related to: (1) Optimum Blends of Available Source Materials (a) We believe that a strategy of aggregating the farm’s soils into three categories and then creating an optimal blend for each category would be an excellent starting point. (2) Optimum GHG Emissions (b) Transportation emissions, spreading emissions, processing emissions, windrow emissions, stock pile emissions (Pre & post), in field emissions. (3) Optimum Economics. (c) Total cost/yard of final product cheaper than current cost to BFCo (Ideally a significant reduction in cost.)",

		"Project Title": "Development of a smartphone-based spectrophotometer for SRM analysis of beer",
		"Background": "The invention of the smartphone has fundamentally changed the way our society functions. We carry around miniaturized computers in our pockets that possess more computing power than the guidance systems for the Apollo 11 space shuttle. This opens up a massive opportunity to harness the computing power and form factor of the smart phone for applications that span all areas of science, technology and medicine. Instead of using these incredible devices to just surf social media and watch cat videos, your project will be to re-create a typical laboratory spectrophotometer using the smartphone as the detection and analysis apparatus for the device. This project will require a truly collaborative effort as the project spans multiple areas of science and engineering.",
		"Problem": "For this project, you will need to design and build a smartphone-based spectrophotometer to measure the color intensity of beer (also known as the Standard Reference Method or SRM). The American Society of Brewing Chemists (ASBC) have set standards for SRM values of different styles of beers. Brewers must conform to the SRM standard (one of many brewing standards) if they are interested in producing a particular style of beer. Color intensity, or SRM measurements, are a quick and easy easure of the quality of the batch; if the color of a given style of beer is off, you can bet that something went awry during the production of the batch. Beer quality measurements that can be made accurately and with low implementation and maintenance costs are extremely important and beneficial to any sized brewery!",
		"Objectives": "Design a smartphone-based spectrophotometer to determine the SRM of samples of beer. High-level goals for the device are as follows: Portability: small form factor devices can be taken or installed anywhere, Repeatability: device should provide consistent results, Accurate: device should be accurate to within appropriate specifications based on theapplication, and Ease of Use: measurements should be easy to take and results easy to obtain. The project will include: Electronics design (electrical engineering), Optical design and alignment (optical engineering), Mechanical design (mechanical engineering), App and algorithm development (software engineering), System-level design and integration (systems engineering). Students will learn and become familiar with: Fundamentals of optics, electronics, mechanical design, algorithm development and app, development, Systems-level design, development and integration, Requirements-driven design and development,Design Verification and Validation testing",

		"Project Title": "MAW Carts improvements",
		"Background": "In 1928 the first recliner was born and a legendary company was founded on the principals of comfort, innovation, and industry-leading craftsmanship. These principals still hold true today and are at the heart of everything we do. From gorgeous stationary furnishings to the iconic recliner, you can count on quality with the La-Z-Boy name. Let us help transform your house into a home. La-Z-Boy prides itself in making a sound product made and assembled in the USA and values the health and safety of their employees. Extending the motto “Live Life Comfortably” from the living room to the workplace is constantly a goal La-Z-Boy strives to accomplish. Some areas which are of attention to accomplishing this goal are as followed:",
		"Problem": "Currently, La-Z-Boy’s cellular manufacturing utilizes MAW (Mobile Assembly Workstation) carts which are used nationwide by La-Z-Boy’s five divisional facilities. Constructed of squared structural members, poly-ethylene surfaces and caster wheels the carts are quite large in size and heavy in weight. The MAW carts are set-up in a series of five or seven depending on the style of chairs being constructed in the cell. The current guiding systems for these MAW Carts are angled iron rails bolted to the ground in a square fashion surrounding the carts, which must then be pushed by the employees so that the unit can be worked on from station-to-station. Once loaded with the various components that comprise the product, the cart gains a significant amount of weight which must still be pushed alongside the guiding rails for the product to be constructed until it reaches the final assembly/inspection station. The additional weight has led to frequent lower back injuries associated with the torsion necessary to move the cart cross the bodies of the operators. Additionally due to the nature of swivel caster wheels, once the cart gets to a corner the operator must exert more force than necessary to ensure the wheels turn and move into position.",
		"Objectives": "Our challenge to the students is to construct a system which will allow the heavy carts to move easily within the geometric constraints of the bolted railings in both directions with minimal user input. These employees are compensated via piecework incentives-- so time is money!",

		"Project Title": "Mobile Charging Station Kiosk",
		"Background": null,
		"Problem": "One of the greatest problem on the UC Merced campus is the lack of available charging ports for electronic devices. This can be seen primarily in the Kolligian Library where students often have to search for outlets to charge their devices. One possible solution to this problem would be to implement a mobile charging station kiosk to allow students to charge their various mobile devices. Another goal of this project is to promote CITRIS to the UC Merced campus using its logo. In order to keep in mind with the mission of CITRIS, the Kiosk will be self-sustained through the use of solar panels. This project is in Phase 2, building on the initial demo and equipment collected from the Capstone project in the Spring. The purpose of this project is to make a self-sustaining mobile charging station. While other such charging stations exist commercially, none provide all of the desired features. An in house solution would be able to provide all of the required features while providing close control over unit costs. Some of the objectives are as follows: (1) provide a reliable source of energy for students to recharge their devices during all school hours (2) provide an easily accessible, yet secure environment At Innovate to Grow, a preliminary design with CAD the kiosk and some components were demonstrated, but not integrated due to time constraints: (1) Functional user interface that allows for selection of lockers using CatCard identification. (2) Acrylic locker demo featuring solenoid lockers. (3) Functional battery and inverter system powering the demo. (3) 3D printed model of a possible locker design.",
		"Objectives": "The overall goal is to complete of a full featured prototype of mobile charging kiosk, using a structure consisting of the locker assembly and sun shade, which can be implemented by the end of the Fall Semester. While the project was not completed by spring of 2016, it did provide insight into the direction. Requirements and features for the Fall semester project include: (1) Determine methods to reduce overall weight of the structure. (2) Utilize the electrical components from the previous phase (inverters, batteries, panels, charge controllers, displays ... totaling several thousands of dollars) so that the additional equipment required is minimal. (3) Improved user interface that would include a name to every locker. (4) Further research and address student concerns over locker security. (4) Determine a process by which one would retrieve forgotten electronics. (5) Provide a management tree that will give an overview of required maintenance and operation procedure. (6) Determine how locker error can be managed and what systems can be implemented to remedy this. (7) Design with the intent of withstanding the most extreme weather conditions in Merced. (8) Implement a system by which the kiosk can be moved easily while retaining security.",

		"Background": null,
		"Problem": "The Department of Animal Research Services (DARS) would like to monitor waste gas (ammonia, CO2) and thermal load levels for all cages in a ventilated caging system in real time. Mating mice in trios allows faculty researchers to produce twice the number of mice using half the number of cages allowing research to proceed at a faster rate at a lower cost. Changing rodent cages less frequently is more cost efficient both in terms of technician time and utilities costs. However, as cage change frequency is pushed out longer and as cage density increases waste gas and thermal load levels may reach an unhealthy state. With a sensor to monitor rodent cage waste gas and thermal load levels, DARS would be able to adjust husbandry practices to be more cost effective while still providing appropriate animal welfare. ",
		"Objectives": "Cage density and trio mating: Trio mating (1M and 2F) of mice for biomedical research has been a popular breeding scheme used for decades. The eighth edition of the “Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals” (the Guide) has new minimum space recommendations for commonly used rodents housed in groups, females with litters. Cage change frequency: With the invention and utilization of Individually Ventilated Caging Systems cage change frequency has been pushed from one week to two weeks routinely industry wide.",

		"Project Title": "Cell SortingCollection Device Improvements",
		"Background": "Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) is a technique to separate heterogeneous cells in liquid suspension into purified populations based on fluorescent labeling. It often utilizes differences in cell surface protein expression to determine cellular populations of interest. FACS has become a widely used technique in the past several decades and is increasing in popularity due to the single cell, high throughput data generated, and the ability to sort live cells for downstream functional assays, such as injection into animals. In the SCIF core facility at UC Merced we have two FACS instruments capable of sorting cells. Cells are sorted into various collection vessels, such as 15ml tubes, 1.5ml tubes, and even onto 96‐well plates. Our cell sorters are manufactured by Becton Dickinson (BD) Biosciences, the company that first commercialized flow cytometry instruments, and continues to be a leading company in new instrument development and applications.",
		"Problem": "One limitation that many core facilities that house FACS instruments have realized is that BD only sells limited collection tube holders. This does not allow for the flexibility to efficiently handle the various sort requests by labs on campus. For example, the largest commercially available tube holder can handle two 15ml tubes. Researchers sorting large quantities of cells often have to go through many collection tubes and would benefit from a tube holder that could accommodate 50ml tubes. A second limitation of current collection tube holders concerns cellular viability. The fluid that runs through the instrument is phosphate buffered saline, which does not contain proteins, such as growth factors, to keep live cells happy. In order to keep cells viable after the sorting process, investigators will often place a small amount of nutrient rich media or animal serum in the bottom of their sort collection tube. However, there is currently no mechanism to agitate the collection tubes to ensure mixing of the sorted cells with the nutrient rich media placed in the collection tube. What occurs is a layering of cells in saline on top of the nutrient rich media. With sorts often lasting hours, this insufficient mixing will affect cellular viability as cells cannot receive the necessary nutrients. Thus, it would be beneficial to have a mechanism to agitate the collection tube.",
		"Objectives": "In addressing the problems with sort collection devices students will learn the principles of flow cytometry and cells sorting. There are two separate objectives for this project. First, obtain faculty input on the collection device formats that they would benefit from and generate novel water‐cooled collection devices to meet their requests. Second, generate a mechanism to mix the samples in the collection tube holders and perform analysis of cellular viability on sorted cells to assess improvement over current design.",

		"Project Title": "Custom Test Rig for Measuring Particle Counts in Oils",
		"Background": "Oils are used as lubricants and hydraulic fluids in a variety of applications. The function of these oils can be hindered by the presence of contaminants or other particles. Contamination is measured and characterized using optical particle counters. However, some oil additives, chemicals that are used to enhance the performance of the base oil, can be identified by these particle counters as contaminants. One means of addressing this issue is to tune the base oil – additive blending process such that the resultant additive particles are too small to be detected. However, there are many challenges associated with this approach, which require further study.",
		"Problem": null,
		"Objectives": "The goal of this project is to design and build a test rig capable of circulating a base oil – additive blended fluid while recording particle counts. The design must be small enough to fit on a laboratory bench top, require relatively small volumes of oil (less than half gallon), and, most importantly, should not further blend the additive into the oil during the circulation process.",

		"Problem": "Intravenous (IV) poles are an essential device at a hospital. As the name implies, the pole is used to hold a patient’s IV solution and infusion pump. Often a patient will have multiple IV’s and infusion pumps making the pole top heavy and unstable. Most poles have wheel bases with as few as four wheels to as many as six wheels but the problem is the wheels can get stuck in the threshold of an elevator or a door making the fully loaded IV pole unstable. The scope of this project would be to redesign the base of the IV pole to make it more stable when crossing thresholds or other uneven surfaces.",
		"Objectives": "(1) Evaluate the current IV pole design to understand why it is unstable. (2) Design a pole or base that can smoothly move across uneven surfaces and elevator gaps of 1 to 11⁄2 inches. (3) Design must be easy for an ambulating patient to control. (4) Design must be able to store neatly next to a patient bed or in a storage room.",

		"Background": "Aerosol delivery systems are an integral part of pulmonary critical care. Medications like bronchodilators, antibiotics, surfactant are delivered as aerosols to the lung as a therapeutic intervention. However such interventions must be done in conjunction with other respiratory life sustaining modalities like ventilators.",
		"Problem": "In the neonatal Intensive Care Unit (ICU) newborn infants are given aerosols while on ventilators. Hence, aerosols are given via endotracheal tubes connected to ventilators. The medications are given to infants while on the ventilator through a side port on the endotracheal tube or disconnected from the ventilator and manually bagged i.e. insufflated. Consequently there is significant asynchrony between the infants breathing and the forces of insufflation. This causes turbulence within the endotracheal tube and as continuous flow ventilators are used, wastage is very significant. Approximately 60 % of the medications results in wall impaction in the trachea or wind pipe and only 2% reaches the lung. Thus the inefficiencies prolong pathology. If efficacy is proven by the product/concept developed by this project, patients benefit from improved efficacy, quicker recovery and decreased costs of care from decreased wastage of medications due to inefficient delivery.",
		"Objectives": "The goal is to develop a product that would deliver the medications in a timely manner, in synchrony with the infants breathing with a near laminar flow within the endotracheal and particle size to optimize delivery of medications to the lung. The system has to be automated working in line with the ventilator. The process would utilize concepts of fluidics of gases to and within the lung of newborns.",

		"Background": "PG&E and other pipeline operators are exploring potential applications of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) to improve their operations and reduce costs. Automated leak survey is one of the most promising applications. The envisioned scenario is the deployment by a utility crew of a sUAS (a helicopter or a fix wing aircraft) equipped with a miniaturized methane detector. The sUAS is totally automated and performs the survey of a segment of pipeline defined by its GPS coordinates. The sUAS flies at a constant altitude of about 10 meters (30 feet) above ground and returns to its launching point to be retrieved by the utility crew.",
		"Problem": "The envisioned scenario is the deployment by a utility crew of a sUAS (a helicopter or a fix wing aircraft) equipped with a miniaturized methane detector. The sUAS is totally automated and performs the survey of a segment of pipeline defined by its GPS coordinates. The sUAS flies at a constant altitude of about 10 meters (30 feet) above ground and returns to its launching point to be retrieved by the utility crew. The data collected by the sUAS is downloaded to be analyzed. A continuous streaming of information from the sUAS to a ground station manned by the utility crew is also envisioned. Peaks of methane in the air indicate the presence of a local emission and are used by the utility crew to locate the possible leaks to be confirmed and repaired later. A key factor of the diffusion of methane is the wind that carries the molecules away from the source.This information is therefore critical for the sUAS in order to optimize its position downwind of the surveyed pipeline and to estimate the location of the possible leak.",
		"Objectives": "The project will aim to develop a simple and cost effective technique to measure the wind direction and speed from the sUAS. The optimal technique must work for a broad range of sUAS and wind speed (0 to 10 m/s). It should consume a minimal amount of energy; the drawn power should be less than a few Watts. Precision should be good enough to provide a good localization of the source of methane and to support the calculation of the optimal trajectory of the sUAS. Deliverables are to (1) Review of the potential techniques and selection of the most effective solution. (2) Design and development of the sensors that will provide the wind direction and speed. (3) Development of the software to process the sensor data and calculate wind direction and speed in real time (latency should be less than half a second). (4) Development of the software to: (1) Provide the area covered by the survey. (2) Provide the possible location of the source of methane related to the peak measured by the methane detector. (3)Provide the optimal path to be followed by the sUAS to assure the best detection of possible leaks. (4) Integration and demonstration of the system on a sUAS.\\",

		"Problem": "Outdoor camera enclosures serve to protect surveillance cameras from extreme weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, dust/sand storms and UV radiation. Sand storms happen in various parts of the world. They are common phenomena in Northern Africa and Middle East but also happen in Northern America and Australia. Often after a sand storm a viewing window of an enclosure is contaminated with sand particles to a degree that a camera would not see through the window and a maintenance person has to be sent to clean the window. Also sand storms can inflict scratches on the enclosure window such that the window has to be replaced. It will be beneficial for the end user to have an enclosure equipped with some kind of a gadget or contraption to protect the window from a sand storm. ",
		"Objectives": "(Option 1: Sand Storm Proof Window)Investigate an abrasion resistant “Sand Storm Proof” window for a camera enclosure which will not be scratched and/or damaged by a sand storm. The requirements for the widow are the following: (1) The optical clarity must support HD camera resolution (1920×1080 pixels) and it is desirable that this window supports 4K camera resolution (3840x2160 pixels) (3) Material and coating (if any) for the window shall be commercially available (4) Determine the cost for this option. (Option 2: Sand Storm Shield Mechanism) Design and build a “Sand Storm Shield” mechanism which will protect the enclosure window from a sand storm. The requirements for the mechanism are the following: (1) The “Sand Storm Shield” shall be automatically activated at the first impact of sand on the enclosure and deactivated after the sand storm passes. (3) The Shield mechanism should operate at ambient temperature from -10 to +60C (4) The Shield mechanism should be IP66 rated (dust tight and water tight) (5) Utilize power supply built in the enclosure for electrical power for the Shield mechanism (6) The “Sand Storm Shield” mechanism should be an add-on or a retrofitted module to an existing enclosure. (7) Necessary modifications to enclosure are permitted. The enclosure must retain all current certifications after the modifications. (8) Determine the cost for this option",

		"Background": "The enclosure market is currently split between a fixed mount version and a full motion product. The fixed mount is non-movable and the end user is required to physical set the camera location during installation. The full motion products are typically heavy on the feature set providing full pan motion, a high amount of tilt angle with additional functionality to provide the ultimate in flexibility. There are few competitors in the mid-market, for products that require limited motion, ease of installation and ease of potential retrofit, into new and existing installations.",
		"Problem": "The proposed concept provides the mid-market needs of simple movements that can operate at limited pan and tilt angles, and limited speeds. From a business point of view, it would be desirable to understand the acceptance of this type of idea/approach into the current marketplace. This concept is not intended to be targeted solely at the Pelco products but across many enclosure lines across the Worldwide Market.",
		"Objectives": "The goal of the project is to create a proto-type model that offers pan and tilt capabilities to fixed camera enclosures the meet Pelco’s specifications (pan motion angle, tilt angle, pan/tilt speed, load, cost, environment). An expanded vision includes developing the electronics and presets and demonstrating ease of assembly, manufacture, and serviceability. If possible, it would be ideal to develop a means to provide feedback of azimuth and elevation of the enclosure/camera location and provide information to motion control system and ultimately implement this functionality into an IP Camera system.",

		"Background": "The California Department of Water Resources (DWR) has purchased a semi-automated ion-exchange system and is seeking methods to fully automate the process to produce water with little to no hardness. In brief, water supplies on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley, California are based on snowfall in the northern portion of the state. During drought years, water for farming is expensive, unavailable, or both. Shallow groundwater exists throughout the farming area (1,000,000 acres +) but is of little value due to the high salt concentrations. Calcium concentrations range from 200 mg/L to 650 mg/L, and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) concentrations are from 1,800 mg/L to 5,000 mg/L (Magnesium concentrations range from 50 mg/L to 150 mg/L). To desalt this water for farming purposes, we plan to test a vapor compression distillation unit that emphasizes energy conservation. The unit is mobile and will be tested on a wide range of water qualities. The vapor compression unit cannot accommodate calcium! Therefore, it is imperative to pretreat the water using a softening method and the method that appears to be feasible is ion-exchange.",
		"Problem": "DWR has had some success with a manually operated softening IX (ion exchange) system that consisted of three - 3 ft3 vessels in series. The system produced softened water at a rate of 6 gallons per minute (GPM). The system operated as follows: Vessel 1-lead, Vessel 2-lag, Vessel 3-regenerated; When Vessel 1 became saturated, Vessel 2-lead, Vessel 3-lag, Vessel 1-regenerated; When Vessel 2 became saturated, Vessel 3-lead, Vessel 1-lag, Vessel 2-regeneration; then the cycle repeated. This procedure appeared to reduce the quantity of brine produced and maximized resin saturation. TDS concentrations were as high as 4,500 mg/L and calcium were as high as 650 mg/L, but product calcium concentrations were not zero. In order to obtain zero calcium concentrations in our experiments, the drainage water had to be diluted to near 2,000 mg/L TDS and 350 mg/L calcium. We do not foresee distilling a great deal of the higher TDS water, but that may be a possibility.",
		"Objectives": "DWR is looking to fully automate our current system to follow the process described above and produce softened water at a rate of 10 GPM with no calcium. We believe that UC Merced staff and students have the capability to modify our units to meet the above mentioned criteria by putting logic design into the operational process. Additional sensors and control valves will also be needed so the system can operate on a continual basis for an extended period of time without the need of staff being on-site to monitor and manually control valves.",

		"Problem": "Scholle Packaging, Pioneer of Bag-in-the-Box flexible packaging, provides solutions to some of the world’s biggest wine brands. At the heart of this company is its innovative taps, most notably the Flextap®, our signature tap. The Flextap® is a product made by combining 3 different injection molded parts to create a functional tap; one of those parts is a seal. This seal is made from a compounded thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) resin and injection molded on a cold runner mold. In cold runner systems, non-usable, excessive material connects molded parts together. This unusable portion of plastic for our system accounts for a 75% scrap rate.",
		"Objectives": "The overall goal of this project is to find solution that would end with the ability to regrind the cold runner sections into pieces small enough to be used directly back into the injection molding process. Additionally, because plastic material retains a heat history which contributes to degradation, the project will also need to investigate, develop and define guidelines or tests of how many iterations of grinding and regrinding could be accomplished before performance of the seal is impacted. The potential impact of this project is two-fold. 1) Direct reduction in scrap production from the injection molding process thereby increasing profitability. 2) Reduction of carbon footprint with decreased use of virgin materials in creating the same number of finish parts.",

		"Problem": "Onion dehydration plants, such as Olam’s Firebaugh, CA location, carry out two general processes: dehydration and milling. Dehydration involves slicing and subsequently removing moisture from raw onions. Milling involves sifting/sizing the “dry” onion flake down to various cut-sizes. Moving the dry onion flake throughout the milling department requires the use of pneumatic networks (piping systems with as air as the working medium). As the dry flake moves through the piping, powder residue is created. Filtering this residue is vital to prevent clogging of the system. Currently, there is no accurate method to monitor air flow rates within the milling department. At any given time, the system may be overloaded (excess air is flowing through the system and therefore excess energy is being utilized) or underloaded (too little air is flowing through the system, and as a result residue will begin to deposit on the inner surfaces of the piping network eventually clogging.)",

		"Problem": "Olam’s tomato plants process more than 8,000 tons of raw tomato per day. Operations begin by harvesting the tomato from the field and packaging the finished product as paste or diced tomato. Since tomato is dug out of the ground, material other than tomato (MOT) makes it to the tomato trucks and inevitably to the plants. Once the trucks reach the plant they are unloaded onto a flume via pressured water. The tomato is water conveyed to elevators that then feed several water flumes that convey the tomato to several pieces of equipment. Although several instruments have been put on the harvesters alone and through the conveying system at the plant, MOT such as sand, rocks, and crop stalks make it to several equipment downstream. This then leads to damaging equipment meant to process tomato only such as dicers and chopper pumps. This not only creates down time but it also adds maintenance cost to all the mechanical equipment.",

		"Background": "The San Francisco Public Utility Commission (SFPUC) owns and operates the Pilarcitos Dam and Stone Dams on Pilarcitos Creek in San Mateo County. Pilarcitos Dam is located upstream of Stone Dam. Stone Dam diverts water from Pilarcitos Creek into the Stone Dam Aqueduct for the Coastside County Water District and trans-watershed diversion to Crystal Springs reservoir. SFPUC releases water on Pilarcitos Creek to meet a voluntary environmental target of 1.5 cfs below Stone Dam.",
		"Problem": "For a portion of the year, the accretion flow between both dams is sufficient to meet the target, but in summer and fall targeted voluntary water requirements are released from Pilarcitos reservoir by a temporary low-flow siphon.",
		"Objectives": "The objective of the project is to re-design the low-flow siphon to improve flow reliability and ease of operation and maintenance.

		"Background": "The San Francisco Public Utility Commission (SFPUC) owns and operates the Pilarcitos Dam and Stone Dams on Pilarcitos Creek in San Mateo County. Pilarcitos Dam is located upstream of Stone Dam. Stone Dam diverts water from Pilarcitos Creek into the Stone Dam Aqueduct for the Coastside County Water District and trans-watershed diversion to Crystal Springs reservoir. SFPUC releases water on Pilarcitos Creek to meet a voluntary environmental target of 1.5 cfs below Stone Dam.",
		"Problem": "For a portion of the year, the accretion flow between both dams is sufficient to meet the target, but in summer and fall targeted voluntary water requirements are released from Pilarcitos reservoir by a temporary low-flow siphon.",
		"Objectives": "The objective of the project is to re-design the low-flow siphon to improve flow reliability and ease of operation and maintenance. The low-flow siphon most be designed to responds to various operational thresholds, which provide operational flexibility based on elevation/head levels in the reservoir to maintain targeted downstream environmental flows. In addition to designing the low flow siphon, the students will need to provide an economic feasibility study for each design configuration.

		"Background": "Electrically powered aircraft have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel. The dramatic increases in efficiency, reliability, and reduced environmental impact have been well-documented for electric powertrains, as is the potential for significant reductions in community noise.",
		"Problem": "Yet, the largest drawback of electrically-powered vehicles has been the onboard energy storage system–namely, its weight, cost, and logistical needs. Battery weight (or reactant storage volume) has especially precluded their utility on aircraft, and the equipment (as well as time) needed to recharge these energy storage systems is lacking at most public use airports. There is dramatic improvement in electric aircraft utility as the mass and volume of the energy storage system is reduced, particularly if such approaches leave the logistics landscape unchanged.",
		"Objectives": "The goal of this design project is to come up with an on-paper design of an all-electric (i.e., no combustion) general aviation aircraft capable of meeting specific performance requirements (for vexample, a given total range, payload capabilities etc.) and ready for operational service by 2020. Being a futuristic concept, some of the technologies may not be advanced enough at this stage and the design team needs to take this into account and outline technology developments that will enable this aircraft to be manufactured in 2020. The final report (25 pages), at the very minimum, should include 3-view drawings, weight contributions of various components, performance parameters, technologies that are required to enable this design as well as a cost-analysis. The outcome of this design project will be submitted to a NASA university competition.",

		"Background": "Sierra Pacific Industries is the second largest lumber producer in the United States. Our Sonora Large Log Sawmill processes logs that generally range from 20” to 70” in diameter. Once the logs are rough cut in the Sawmill, the lumber then goes through our Dry Kilns. This is a controlled drying process using steam produced by byproducts through our Co-Generation plant (Co-Gen). At the end of the drying process, we inject live steam into the Dry Kiln to condition the lumber.",
		"Problem": null,
		"Objectives": "Sierra Pacific Industries would like to find a way to use a different water source (local utilities district or other means) to replicate the live steam process and keep the water from touching the lumber in order to conserve the treated water. The steam from the CoGen contains treated water that can be utilized more efficiently in the Turbine. This Turbine generates up to 7.5 MegaWatts of electricity to power the facility and excess power to PG&E.",

In an average year, California produces 20% of the sweet potatoes grown in the US, with the primary production area being in the sandy oils between Atwater and Turlock in Stanislaus and Merced Counties. D&S Farms/Atwater Packing is responsible for growing, harvesting, storing and distribution a large number of those. The growing process starts with cuttings from runners. Every year, the seed stock is saved, buried, and then used to grow runner vines to put in the ground for planting.

		"Background": "Yosemite National Park is comprised of 750,000 acres or 1200 square miles. Four million domestic and international visitors visit the park every year. The overall area of the park includes over 706,000 acres of backcountry, designated by congress as formal wilderness. A wilderness designation means that the National Park Service must – by law - manage the area in such a way that no modern technology may be permanently placed within and only essential permanent structures may be maintained. In the United States, wilderness is the highest form of land management protection and exists because there is in this country a formal sense that some of our landscapes should be protected in their wild form for natural functions to occur unimpaired and for the people to enjoy. Beyond the developed infrastructure of the popular front-country visitor areas in Yosemite – there are over 706,000 acres of wilderness backcountry. This immense area is accessed by over 800 miles of hiking and stock trails enjoyed by 57,000 users - for a total of 155,000 user-nights each year. Over the decades, the Park Service has evolved to the use of composting toilets in particular spots in the backcountry where hiking and camping use is the heaviest and other forms of waste management are environmentally unsound.",
		"Problem": "To date, no form of commercially available composting toilet is suitable to the task. In theory, the combination of microbial action with heat in digestion chambers should convert solid waste into inert ash that is safe to handle and dispose of. In practice – because of heavy use and inadequate design – backcountry facility managers are forced to haul liquid waste slurry out of the backcountry on livestock for disposal in conventional dumpsites. This practice is patently unsafe for the environment, should an accident occur with livestock; and poses potential health risks to handlers, and contamination potential in watershed streams. It is also expensive, time-consuming, and places unnecessary impacts on the wilderness environment.",
		"Objectives": "Design an off-grid reliable and inexpensive solution to existing, commercially available composting toilets. The design should be considered in modularized forms that lend themselves to easy transportation to remote sites and assembly in wilderness environments. Materials should be envisioned to withstand environmental extremes of temperature, humidity, seismicity, and wind. Accordingly, this redesign will have positive consequences for similarly situated park waste management challenges around the world. Likewise, there will be intentional positive applications with organizations such as the UN and poverty fighting field programs of NGO’s (such as the World Bank) working to support emerging societies with remote communities facing challenges of human waste management, clean water, reduction of disease, and human conflict.",

		"Background": "Merced Irrigation District owns and operates the New Exchequer Hydroelectric Power Plant. The plant is located just below the New Exchequer Dam which impounds Lake McClure for irrigation and hydroelectric purposes. With a plant capacity of 94.5 megawatts, New Exchequer delivers approximately 300,000 megawatt-hours with its single generator. This generator was initially built in 1964, and since, has undergone a variety of refurbishments (e.g., bearing replacement, realignment, turbine replacement, and coil rewinding).",
		"Problem": "Many of these refurbishments require the removal of the 60,000 lb. turbine. A lifting device is currently used to do so, however, past experience has proven the device to be troublesome when lifting and reinstalling the turbine. This is because the lifting device only allows for vertical motion on a turbine that must be raised flush with the bottom surface of the turbine shaft mating surface. Without the ability to adjust the angle or tilt of rise, it is very difficult to accurately mate the two 7 foot diameter surfaces to within 0.002 inches while maintaining a 0.020 inch clearance between the 140 inch outside diameter of the turbine and the surrounding structures.",
		"Objectives": "The existing device is hung from the turbine shaft and the operator is attached to the turbine. Using a single motor simultaneously driving 4 gearboxes, the device climbs threaded shafts(10) which raise and lower the device and turbine. There is no provision to independently drive the gearboxes or make other adjustments. Instead, the original manufacturer procedure utilizes a tedious process involving the use of shims to accurately fit the turbine to the turbine shaft. The objective of this project is to redesign the existing lifting device to provide for angular/tilt adjustment thus simplifying the coupling of the turbine to the turbine shaft to a very fine tolerance. The project will involve examination of existing design and materials, operating equipment, design of a similar machine and/or modification to the existing device, submittal of CAD drawings, and constructing a test fixture for system verification.",

		"Background": "Every year there are over 500,000 bike related injuries reported in the US alone. Many of these incidents occur at night due to poor visibility of cyclists in both rear and sides of the rider.",
		"Problem": "Rising levels of greenhouse emissions caused by motorists around the world has sparked a resurgence in commuting by bike, but many cyclists are worried about their safety as they ride inches away from 2-ton machines barreling down the street. If motor vehicles are required to have headlamps, turn signals, and brake lights, why arent cyclists who are also, by law, required to share the same roadways, held up to the same visibility standards?",
		"Objectives": "Create a bike wheel with integrated lights using Electroluminescent (EL) wire. Ideally, the system would be completely closed with power being supplied by a dynamo hub so that the rider will never have to charge their wheel. The wheel should be modular so that it can be used by road, mountain, and commuter bikes.",

		"Background": "As the largest winery in the world, E&J Gallo is a major consumer of potable water. As such, Gallo is striving to identify ways in which we can reduce water usage at all steps in the process. At Gallo’s grape crushing facilities, the grape process starts at our receiving pits at which grape trucks are dumped and washed. For this process, an employee is staffed with the task of hooking up gondola bins and washing the bins out after being dumped.",
		"Problem": "The bins are currently washed with a manually operated hose process, which is reliant on the operator to moderate. This introduces the potential to over use water, causing waste of a valuable resource, and potentially diluting the wine and juice product, potentially costing the winery in terms of excess water usage, and downgraded product due to dilution. In attempts to mitigate the over use of water at this process step, the Fresno Winery would like to find a solution for automating, optimizing, and metering the gondola wash system for grape receiving.",
		"Objectives": "Research, develop and design a system for an automated, metered, and efficient gondola wash system. The design should include a complete cost estimate for implementation including the projected return on the investment for the system with safety and risk implications documented.",

		"Background": "One approach to reducing wrist factures involves affixing the patient’s fingers to a device and then weighting the arm. This facilitates the bones coming into alignment and can prevent the need for being put to sleep to reduce manually. The device used currently for this purpose requires trapping each finger in a metal mesh clamp and is both time-consuming and painful for the patient.",

		"Background": "The UC Merced Department of Animal Research Services (DARS) houses a Mark I Model 30 Cesium-137 irradiator. The cesium irradiator is designed principally for biomedical research. Its purpose is to provide accurate, convenient and reliable access to ionizing radiation to investigators for irradiations of molecular compounds, cell culture, animal and human tumor cells and whole animal experiments. The cesium irradiator serves as a useful research tool for researchers who are studying the effects of radiation on biological samples, animals, and cells in culture or are using radiation as part of their experiments to create mutations for studying the biologic effect of radiation, of mutations themselves, or for immunosuppression. It offers a wide range of dose rates, collimation and a controlled environment for irradiation of samples. Dose is controlled by tuning the time and spatial position of the sample within the irradiator.",
		"Problem": "Currently dose control is limited by lack of confidence in the manufacturer provided iso-dose curves and by the fact that precise dosage is dependent on the sample itself.",
		"Objectives": "DARS would like to address these issues with two-fold project. First, the calibration curves can be verified by time- and space-dependent testing of the instrument. Second, tissue-specific phantoms (samples consisting of a specific tissue type) can be designed that allow testing of dosage as a function of distance from the sample surface. Both activities will involve understanding the UC Merced irradiator and its functionality, but have significant potential for larger-scale impact for improved, sample-specific dose control.",

		"Background": "In the event of an emergency, it is imperative to contain and disseminate information. Everyone is curious, and the need to discover what is happening often draws a crowd. As the crowd gathers and ruminates, the emergency may be worsened, possibly endangering the public. In the interest of public safety, getting the right information out in a timely manner in as many formats as possible is essential.",
		"Problem": "Various media formats should be made available and easily controlled by emergency personnel from a centralized location. Messages should be displayed visually and posted at intersections to alert drivers. An audio message with a repeating, recorded message should also be broadcast. There are two aspects of this project. The first involves researching all available hardware and the proper techniques to control them. The second looks into software and connectivity to disseminate the information automatically to the hardware.",
		"Objectives": "The goal of the interdisciplinary team that will work on this project is to design and develop a prototype of a new broadcasting device that communicates information to the public effectively and efficiently. Once the system and mechanism is in place, it will be used by the campus police and other local law enforcement for regular events and broadcasting information, in addition to emergency alerts.",
